Combien (en dollars) gagne-t-elle chaque jour au marché fermier ?", "answer": "18", "raw_response": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about Janet and her ducks. Let me try to figure out how much she makes each day from selling the eggs. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. That seems straightforward. So, every day, she starts with 16 eggs. Got that.\n\nNext, every morning, she eats three eggs for breakfast. So, she uses three eggs just for her own consumption. Then, she uses another four eggs to make muffins for her friends. So, that's another four eggs gone. I need to figure out how many eggs are left after she uses them for breakfast and for the muffins.\n\nLet me write this down to keep track:\n\nTotal eggs per day = 16\n\nEggs eaten for breakfast = 3\n\nEggs used for muffins = 4\n\nSo, the total number of eggs she uses each day is 3 + 4, which is 7 eggs. That seems right. So, to find out how many eggs are left for selling, I subtract the total eggs used from the total eggs laid.\n\nEggs left for selling = Total eggs - (Eggs eaten + Eggs used for muffins)\nEggs left for selling = 16 - (3 + 4) = 16 - 7 = 9\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. 16 minus 7 is actually 9. Hmm, so she has 9 eggs left each day to sell at the farmer's market.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes here. So, 16 eggs in total, subtract 3 for breakfast, subtract 4 for muffins. 16 - 3 is 13, and 13 - 4 is 9. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNow, each of these remaining eggs is sold at $2 per egg. So, to find out how much she makes each day, I need to multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg.\n\nSo, money made = Number of eggs sold * Price per egg\nMoney made = 9 * $2 = $18\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me think if there's anything else I need to consider here. The problem doesn't mention any costs or expenses, so it's just the revenue from selling the eggs. So, it's straightforward multiplication.\n\nIs there a possibility that I misread the number of eggs or the prices? Let me check again. The ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three, uses four for muffins. So, 16 minus 3 minus 4 is indeed 9 eggs left. Each egg is sold for $2, so 9 times 2 is $18. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I can calculate it in another way. If she sells 9 eggs at $2 each, then 10 eggs would be $20, so subtracting one egg's price, which is $2, gives $18. Yeah, that also works.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the eggs she doesn't sell. She eats 3 and uses 4, so 7 eggs not sold. 16 total minus 7 sold is 9. 9 times 2 is 18. Yep, consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that the calculation is correct. So, the answer should be $18 per day.\n\n**Final Answer**\nJanet gagne \\boxed{18} dollars chaque jour au marché fermier.\n</think>\n\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

{"idx": 1, "question": "Une robe nécessite 2 rouleaux de fibre bleue et la moitié de cette quantité en fibre blanche. Combien faut-il de rouleaux au total ?", "answer": "3", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about how many rolls of fabric are needed in total for a dress. It says that a dress requires 2 rolls of blue fiber and half of that quantity in white fiber. I need to find the total number of rolls required.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. The dress needs 2 rolls of blue fiber. That part is straightforward. Now, for the white fiber, it's half of the blue fiber's quantity. Hmm, so if blue is 2 rolls, then white should be half of 2. Let me write that down to visualize it better.\n\nBlue fiber: 2 rolls\nWhite fiber: half of blue's quantity\n\nSo, mathematically, that would be white fiber = (1/2) * blue fiber. Since blue fiber is 2, then white fiber is (1/2)*2.\n\nCalculating that: (1/2)*2 = 1. So, the white fiber needed is 1 roll.\n\nNow, to find the total number of rolls, I need to add both the blue and white rolls together.\n\nTotal rolls = blue rolls + white rolls\nTotal rolls = 2 + 1\n\nSo, 2 + 1 equals 3. Therefore, the total number of rolls needed is 3.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem mentions \"rouleaux\" which I believe is rolls in French, so that's consistent. It specifies both blue and white fibers, and the quantities are 2 and half of that, which I converted correctly.\n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted? For example, could \"la moitié de cette quantité\" refer to something else? I don't think so because \"cette quantité\" refers back to the quantity mentioned before, which is the 2 rolls of blue fiber. So, half of that is indeed 1 roll.\n\nAnother thing to check: units. Both quantities are in rolls, so adding them directly makes sense. If they were in different units, I might have to convert them, but since they're both rolls, it's straightforward.\n\nSo, blue: 2 rolls, white: 1 roll, total: 3 rolls. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a pretty straightforward problem once I break it down into parts. First, find the quantity for each color separately and then add them together.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as a ratio problem. The ratio of blue to white is 2:1 because for every 2 rolls of blue, you need 1 roll of white. So, the total ratio is 3 parts. Therefore, the total rolls are 3, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nI guess that confirms it. No, wait, let me just write it out again to be thorough.\n\nBlue fiber = 2 rolls\nWhite fiber = (1/2)*2 = 1 roll\nTotal = 2 + 1 = 3 rolls\n\nYes, that's consistent. I don't see any reason to doubt this answer. It's a simple arithmetic problem, but it's always good to double-check, especially if you're just starting out with these kinds of problems.\n\nAnother way to look at it: if 2 rolls of blue are needed, and white is half that, you could also think about combining them in terms of fractions. So, 2 rolls is the same as 2/1, and white is 1/2 of that. So, 2/1 multiplied by 1/2 is 1, as I calculated before. Then, adding 2 and 1 gives 3.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any alternative interpretations or calculation errors here. Maybe if the problem had said something like \"half as much in total,\" but no, it specifically says \"la moitié de cette quantité en fibre blanche,\" which clearly refers to half the quantity of blue fiber.\n\nAlso, considering units again: both are rolls, so adding them is permissible. If one was in meters and the other in rolls, we would have a problem, but since they're both in rolls, it's fine.\n\nIn conclusion, after breaking it down, checking my calculations, and ensuring that the interpretation of the problem is correct, I can confidently say that the total number of rolls needed is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nLe nombre total de rouleaux nécessaire est \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nPour déterminer le nombre total de rouleaux nécessaires pour une robe, nous commençons par identifier les quantités de chaque fibre utilisée.\n\n1.

Quel bénéfice a-t-il réalisé ?", "answer": "70000", "raw_response": "Okay, so Josh is renovating a house. He bought it for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 on restoration. After that, the value of the house increased by 150%. I need to figure out what profit he made. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the total cost Josh incurred. He bought the house for $80,000, and then he invested another $50,000 into restoring it. So, the total amount he spent is the sum of these two. Let me write that down:\n\nTotal Investment = Purchase Price + Restoration Cost\nTotal Investment = $80,000 + $50,000\n\nCalculating that, 80,000 plus 50,000 is 130,000. So, Josh has spent a total of $130,000 on the house.\n\nNow, the next part is about the value of the house increasing by 150%. I need to figure out what that means in dollar terms. Is it 150% of the original purchase price, or 150% of the current value after restoration? Hmm, the problem says \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%.\" The wording is a bit unclear, but I think it refers to the value after his investment. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Josh se lance dans la rénovation d'une maison. Il en achète une au prix de 80 000 $ et investit 50 000 $ dans sa restauration. La valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150 %. Quel bénéfice a-t-il réalisé ?\"\n\nSo, he bought it for 80k, invested 50k, and then the value increased by 150%. It doesn't specify from what, but in real estate, when they say the value increases by a percentage, it's usually from the original value unless stated otherwise. But in this case, he invested more into it, so maybe the increase is on the current value after restoration.\n\nWait, but the original purchase price was 80k, and he added 50k, making the total investment 130k. So, if the value increases by 150%, does that mean it's 150% of 80k, or 150% of 130k? Hmm.\n\nIn French, the phrase is \"augmente alors de 150%\". The word \"alors\" might imply that after the restoration, the value increased by 150% from its previous value. So, the previous value would be the purchase price, or the purchase price plus the restoration cost?\n\nI think it's likely that the value increased by 150% from its original purchase price because usually, when people talk about the value of a property increasing, they refer to the original value. But in this case, he's added value through restoration. So, maybe it's 150% of the purchase price, or 150% of the total investment.\n\nWait, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think about both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: The value increases by 150% of the original purchase price, which was $80,000. So, 150% of 80k is 0.15*80,000 = 12,000? Wait, no, 150% is 1.5 times. So, 1.5 times 80,000 is 120,000. So, the increase would be 120,000. So, the new value would be 80,000 + 120,000 = $200,000.\n\nSecond possibility: The value increases by 150% of the total investment, which is 130,000. So, 150% of 130k is 1.5*130,000 = 195,000. So, the new value would be 130,000 + 195,000 = $325,000.\n\nWhich one is it? Hmm. In French, \"augmenter de 150%\" generally means an increase of 150% of the original amount. So, if the original value is 80,000, then increasing by 150% would mean adding 150% of 80k, which is 120k, so total value becomes 200k. But in this case, he has invested more into the house, so maybe the base for the percentage increase is different.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes when you invest into a property, the value is considered as the cost after investment. So, if he bought it for 80k, invested 50k, the total cost is 130k, and then the value increases by 150%, meaning the value becomes 130k + 150% of 130k, which is 130k + 195k = 325k.\n\nI need to figure out which interpretation is correct. Let me think about the phrasing again: \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%\". It doesn't specify from what, so it's ambiguous. But in French, \"augmenter de\" usually refers to the original amount unless specified otherwise. So, if the original value was 80k, then the increase is 150% of 80k, so 120k added, making it 200k.\n\nBut wait, after restoration, the value is likely based on the current value, which is after the investment. So, maybe the increase is on the current value. So, if the current value is 130k, the 150% increase would be on top of that.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because he invested in restoration, so the value after restoration is higher. Therefore, the increase would be on the restoration-invested value. So, maybe 150% increase on 130k.\n\nBut let me check with another angle. If the increase is 150%, that could mean the new value is 250% of the original. Because if you increase by 150%, the new value is 100% + 150% = 250% of the original. So, if original is 80k, new value is 200k. Alternatively, if the base is the current value after restoration, then the new value is 130k + 150% of 130k = 325k.\n\nSo, depending on the base, the result is different. Since the problem says \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%\", it's a bit tricky because the house's value could be considered either from the purchase price or from the restored value.\n\nWait, but in real estate, when you restore a property, the value is based on the current market after restoration. So, if he bought it for 80k, restored it for 50k, making the total investment 130k, then the value of the house after restoration is probably higher, and then it increases by 150% from that restored value. So, the increase is on top of 130k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the increase is from the original 80k, regardless of the restoration cost. So, the value went from 80k to 80k + 150% of 80k = 200k.\n\nGiven that, let's consider both scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: increase is 150% from the purchase price.\n\nOriginal Value: 80,000\n\nIncrease: 150% of 80,000 = 1.5 * 80,000 = 120,000\n\nNew Value: 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\n\nProfit: New Value - Total Investment = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\n\nSecond scenario: increase is 150% from the restored value.\n\nRestored Value: 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\n\nIncrease: 150% of 130,000 = 1.5 * 130,000 = 195,000\n\nNew Value: 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000\n\nProfit: 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000\n\nSo, which one is correct? Hmm.\n\nIn French, \"augmenter de 150%\" without any additional prepositions usually means an increase of 150% of the original amount, which is the purchase price. So, 150% increase on 80k, making it 200k.\n\nBut in the context of renovation, sometimes the value is considered after the investment. So, the increase is on the current value, which is 130k.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, so maybe I should see if there's a standard interpretation.\n\nWait, let's think about the wording again: \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%\". The word \"alors\" might suggest that this increase happens after the restoration. So, perhaps the value is increased by 150% from its value after restoration.\n\nSo, in that case, the base is 130k, and the increase is 150% of that, leading to 325k.\n\nAlternatively, if it's an increase of 150% from the purchase price, regardless of the restoration, it's 200k.\n\nHmm. I think the key is whether the increase is on the original purchase price or on the current value after restoration. Since the problem mentions that he invested in restoration, it's likely that the increase is on top of that. So, the 150% increase is on the 130k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not, because 150% is a significant jump. If he bought it for 80k and increased by 150%, so 80k + 120k = 200k, that's still a 150% increase. Alternatively, if it's 150% increase from the restored value, 130k becomes 325k.\n\nWait, maybe the question is in French, so perhaps I can look for similar problems or standard interpretations. In French, when they say \"la valeur augmente de X%\", it usually means an increase on the original value, not the current value unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, for example, if something was worth 100 and increases by 50%, it becomes 150. So, in that case, \"augmenter de 50%\" would be adding 50% of the original value.\n\nTherefore, in this problem, \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%\" would mean that the value increases by 150% of the original purchase price, which was 80,000.\n\nSo, 150% of 80,000 is 120,000, so the new value is 200,000.\n\nTherefore, Josh's profit would be the new value minus his total investment, which was 130,000.\n\nSo, 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000.\n\nTherefore, his profit is 70,000.\n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe the increase is from the current value after restoration. So, he bought it for 80k, spent 50k, so the current value is 130k. Then, the value increases by 150%, so 150% of 130k is 195k. So, the new value is 130k + 195k = 325k. So, profit is 325k - 130k = 195k.\n\nSo, which is it? Hmm.\n\nI think the key is to understand that when they say the value increases by 150%, unless specified otherwise, it's usually from the original value. So, in that case, it's 150% of 80k, making the new value 200k, so profit is 70k.\n\nBut in this case, he has invested 50k into restoration, so maybe the increase is on the current value, which is 130k. So, 150% increase on 130k.\n\nWait, let's think about it in terms of real estate. When you buy a property and renovate it, the value after renovation is higher, but the increase is not necessarily based on the purchase price. So, if the value increases by 150%, it's likely referring to the current value after restoration.\n\nSo, in that case, the 150% increase is on 130k, so 150% of 130k is 195k, so the new value is 130k + 195k = 325k. So, the profit is 325k - 130k = 195k.\n\nAlternatively, if it's 150% of the purchase price, he just made 70k profit.\n\nBut, I think in most problems, when they say the value increases by a percentage without specifying, it's from the original value. So, in that case, 150% of 80k, which is 120k added, making it 200k, so profit is 70k.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the problem expects the increase to be on the total investment.\n\nWait, let's check the wording again. It says: \"Josh se lance dans la rénovation d'une maison. Il en achète une au prix de 80 000 $ et investit 50 000 $ dans sa restauration. La valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150 %. Quel bénéfice a-t-il réalisé ?\"\n\nThe key here is \"alors de 150%\", which is after the restoration. So, maybe the increase is from the restored value. So, the current value after restoration is 130k, and it increases by 150%, so 130k * 2.5 = 325k.\n\nTherefore, profit would be 325k - 130k = 195k.\n\nBut another way, if the increase is from the original purchase price, it's 80k * 2.5 = 200k. So, profit is 200k - 130k = 70k.\n\nSo, which interpretation is correct?\n\nIn French, \"augmenter de\" generally refers to an increase over the original value. So, for example, \"le prix a augmenté de 20%\" means the price went up by 20%, i.e., 20% of the original price.\n\nBut in this case, the original value is 80k, but he has spent 50k on restoration, so the value after restoration might be considered as the new base.\n\nWait, perhaps not. The problem says he bought it for 80k, invested 50k, and then the value increased by 150%. So, the increase is after his investment, but does that mean the increase is on the investment amount or on the original price?\n\nHmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think about another similar problem. Suppose someone buys a car for 20k, spends 5k on repairs, and then the value increases by 50%. What's the profit? Is the increase on the original 20k or on the 25k?\n\nIn most cases, I think the increase is on the original value unless specified otherwise. So, 50% of 20k is 10k, so new value is 30k, so profit is 30k - 25k = 5k.\n\nAlternatively, if the increase is on the 25k, then 50% of 25k is 12.5k, so new value is 37.5k, profit is 12.5k.\n\nSo, which one is correct? I think it's the former, because the increase is usually on the original value unless it's stated otherwise.\n\nBut in this case, the context is renovation, so maybe the value is increased based on the investment.\n\nWait, the problem says \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%\", so it's after the restoration. So, maybe the increase is on the restored value, which is 130k.\n\nTherefore, the increase is 150% of 130k, which is 195k, so new value is 325k, profit is 195k.\n\nAlternatively, if it's 150% of the original 80k, then new value is 200k, profit is 70k.\n\nHmm. Since the problem says \"alors de 150%\", which is after the restoration, it's possible that the increase is on the restored value.\n\nBut in French, \"augmenter de\" is generally an increase over the original amount. So, \"augmenter de 150%\" would mean adding 150% of the original value.\n\nSo, if the original value was 80k, then the increase is 120k, making the new value 200k.\n\nTherefore, profit is 200k - 130k = 70k.\n\nBut now, I feel like I'm going in circles. Both interpretations are possible.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the increase is given as a percentage, so if it's 150%, that's a multiplier of 1.5 times. So, if it's on the original value, 80k * 1.5 = 120k, but that would be the increase, not the total value. Wait, no, 150% increase would mean 100% + 150% = 250%, so 80k * 2.5 = 200k.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a 150% markup on the cost, then the selling price would be 130k * 2.5 = 325k.\n\nBut in French, \"augmenter de 150%\" is ambiguous whether it's an increase of 150% (i.e., total becomes 250%) or a multiplication factor of 1.5.\n\nWait, no, in French, \"augmenter de 150%\" means an increase of 150% of the original amount, so the new value is 100% + 150% = 250% of the original.\n\nTherefore, if the original is 80k, new value is 200k.\n\nBut if the original is considered as the value after restoration, which is 130k, then the new value is 130k * 2.5 = 325k.\n\nSo, depending on which original value we take.\n\nSince the problem first mentions the purchase price, and then the restoration investment, and then the increase, it's a bit unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the increase is on the total investment, meaning 150% of 130k, so 195k profit. But that can't be, because profit is selling price minus cost, which would be 130k + 195k - 130k = 195k.\n\nAlternatively, if the selling price is 130k + 195k = 325k, then profit is 195k.\n\nBut in French, when they say \"augmenter de 150%\", it's an increase of 150% of the original value.\n\nSo, original value is 80k, so increase is 120k, new value is 200k, profit is 70k.\n\nAlternatively, if the original value is 130k, then increase is 195k, new value is 325k, profit is 195k.\n\nSo, which is it? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the original value is 80k, so the increase is 150% of 80k, so 120k, making the new value 200k, so profit is 70k.\n\nBut if the 150% increase is on the total investment, then it's 195k profit.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%\". The word \"alors\" is after the restoration. So, perhaps the increase is on the restored value.\n\nTherefore, the restored value is 130k, and the increase is 150% of that, so 195k, making the new value 325k, so profit is 195k.\n\nAlternatively, the increase is 150% of the original, so 200k, profit is 70k.\n\nI think in this case, since the increase happens \"alors\" (then), after the restoration, it's referring to the increased value after the restoration. So, the increase is on the restored value.\n\nTherefore, the new value is 130k + 150% of 130k = 325k, so profit is 195k.\n\nWait, but \"augmenter de 150%\" is an increase of 150%, so 150% of the value. So, if the value is 130k, then 150% of that is 195k, so the new value is 325k.\n\nTherefore, profit is 325k - 130k = 195k.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct interpretation.\n\nTherefore, Josh's profit is $195,000.\n\nWait, but let me check with the problem again.\n\n\"Josh se lance dans la rénovation d'une maison. Il en achète une au prix de 80 000 $ et investit 50 000 $ dans sa restauration. La valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150 %. Quel bénéfice a-t-il réalisé ?\"\n\nSo, he bought it for 80k, invested 50k, then the value increased by 150%. So, the increase is after the investment.\n\nTherefore, the increase is on the current value, which is 80k + 50k = 130k.\n\nSo, 150% increase on 130k, so 130k * 2.5 = 325k.\n\nTherefore, profit is 325k - 130k = 195k.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $195,000 profit.\n\nBut wait, 150% increase is 1.5 times the original, but sometimes people say \"augmenter de 150%\" as in adding 150%, so total is 250%.\n\nWait, in French, \"augmenter de 150%\" is the same as \"an increase of 150%\", which is the amount added, not the total. So, if the original is 100, an increase of 150% would make it 250.\n\nBut in some contexts, people say \"augmenter de 150%\" to mean multiplying by 1.5.\n\nWait, no, in French, \"augmenter de 150%\" is an increase of 150%, so the total is 100% + 150% = 250%.\n\nSo, for example, if something was 100, and it increases by 150%, it becomes 250.\n\nSo, in this case, if the original value was 80k, then the new value is 80k + 150% of 80k = 80k + 120k = 200k.\n\nBut if the original value is considered after restoration, which is 130k, then the new value is 130k + 150% of 130k = 130k + 195k = 325k.\n\nSo, depending on which original value we take.\n\nBut since the problem says \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%\", and \"alors\" refers to after the restoration, I think the original value for the increase is after the restoration, which is 130k.\n\nTherefore, 130k + 150% of 130k = 325k, so profit is 325k - 130k = 195k.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $195,000.\n\nAlternatively, if the increase is on the purchase price, it's 70k, but I think the correct interpretation is on the restored value.\n\nTherefore, I will go with $195,000 profit.\n\n**Final Answer**\nLe bénéfice réalisé par Josh est de \\boxed{195000} dollars.\n</think>\n\nJosh achète une maison pour 80 000 $ et investit 50 000 $ dans sa restauration.

He bought it for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 on restoration. After that, the value of the house increased by 150%. I need to figure out what profit he made. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the total cost Josh incurred. He bought the house for $80,000, and then he invested another $50,000 into restoring it. So, the total amount he spent is the sum of these two. Let me write that down:\n\nTotal Investment = Purchase Price + Restoration Cost\nTotal Investment = $80,000 + $50,000\n\nCalculating that, 80,000 plus 50,000 is 130,000. So, Josh has spent a total of $130,000 on the house.\n\nNow, the next part is about the value of the house increasing by 150%. I need to figure out what that means in dollar terms. Is it 150% of the original purchase price, or 150% of the current value after restoration? Hmm, the problem says \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%.\" The wording is a bit unclear, but I think it refers to the value after his investment. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Josh se lance dans la rénovation d'une maison. Il en achète une au prix de 80 000 $ et investit 50 000 $ dans sa restauration. La valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150 %. Quel bénéfice a-t-il réalisé ?\"\n\nSo, he bought it for 80k, invested 50k, and then the value increased by 150%. It doesn't specify from what, but in real estate, when they say the value increases by a percentage, it's usually from the original value unless stated otherwise. But in this case, he invested more into it, so maybe the increase is on the current value after restoration.\n\nWait, but the original purchase price was 80k, and he added 50k, making the total investment 130k. So, if the value increases by 150%, does that mean it's 150% of 80k, or 150% of 130k? Hmm.\n\nIn French, the phrase is \"augmente alors de 150%\". The word \"alors\" might imply that after the restoration, the value increased by 150% from its previous value. So, the previous value would be the purchase price, or the purchase price plus the restoration cost?\n\nI think it's likely that the value increased by 150% from its original purchase price because usually, when people talk about the value of a property increasing, they refer to the original value. But in this case, he's added value through restoration. So, maybe it's 150% of the purchase price, or 150% of the total investment.\n\nWait, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think about both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: The value increases by 150% of the original purchase price, which was $80,000. So, 150% of 80k is 0.15*80,000 = 12,000? Wait, no, 150% is 1.5 times. So, 1.5 times 80,000 is 120,000. So, the increase would be 120,000. So, the new value would be 80,000 + 120,000 = $200,000.\n\nSecond possibility: The value increases by 150% of the total investment, which is 130,000. So, 150% of 130k is 1.5*130,000 = 195,000. So, the new value would be 130,000 + 195,000 = $325,000.\n\nWhich one is it? Hmm. In French, \"augmenter de 150%\" generally means an increase of 150% of the original amount. So, if the original value is 80,000, then increasing by 150% would mean adding 150% of 80k, which is 120k, so total value becomes 200k. But in this case, he has invested more into the house, so maybe the base for the percentage increase is different.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes when you invest into a property, the value is considered as the cost after investment. So, if he bought it for 80k, invested 50k, the total cost is 130k, and then the value increases by 150%, meaning the value becomes 130k + 150% of 130k, which is 130k + 195k = 325k.\n\nI need to figure out which interpretation is correct. Let me think about the phrasing again: \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%\". It doesn't specify from what, so it's ambiguous. But in French, \"augmenter de\" usually refers to the original amount unless specified otherwise. So, if the original value was 80k, then the increase is 150% of 80k, so 120k added, making it 200k.\n\nBut wait, after restoration, the value is likely based on the current value, which is after the investment. So, maybe the increase is on the current value. So, if the current value is 130k, the 150% increase would be on top of that.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because he invested in restoration, so the value after restoration is higher. Therefore, the increase would be on the restoration-invested value. So, maybe 150% increase on 130k.\n\nBut let me check with another angle. If the increase is 150%, that could mean the new value is 250% of the original. Because if you increase by 150%, the new value is 100% + 150% = 250% of the original. So, if original is 80k, new value is 200k. Alternatively, if the base is the current value after restoration, then the new value is 130k + 150% of 130k = 325k.\n\nSo, depending on the base, the result is different. Since the problem says \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%\", it's a bit tricky because the house's value could be considered either from the purchase price or from the restored value.\n\nWait, but in real estate, when you restore a property, the value is based on the current market after restoration. So, if he bought it for 80k, restored it for 50k, making the total investment 130k, then the value of the house after restoration is probably higher, and then it increases by 150% from that restored value. So, the increase is on top of 130k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the increase is from the original 80k, regardless of the restoration cost. So, the value went from 80k to 80k + 150% of 80k = 200k.\n\nGiven that, let's consider both scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: increase is 150% from the purchase price.\n\nOriginal Value: 80,000\n\nIncrease: 150% of 80,000 = 1.5 * 80,000 = 120,000\n\nNew Value: 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\n\nProfit: New Value - Total Investment = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\n\nSecond scenario: increase is 150% from the restored value.\n\nRestored Value: 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\n\nIncrease: 150% of 130,000 = 1.5 * 130,000 = 195,000\n\nNew Value: 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000\n\nProfit: 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000\n\nSo, which one is correct? Hmm.\n\nIn French, \"augmenter de 150%\" without any additional prepositions usually means an increase of 150% of the original amount, which is the purchase price. So, 150% increase on 80k, making it 200k.\n\nBut in the context of renovation, sometimes the value is considered after the investment. So, the increase is on the current value, which is 130k.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, so maybe I should see if there's a standard interpretation.\n\nWait, let's think about the wording again: \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%\". The word \"alors\" might suggest that this increase happens after the restoration. So, perhaps the value is increased by 150% from its value after restoration.\n\nSo, in that case, the base is 130k, and the increase is 150% of that, leading to 325k.\n\nAlternatively, if it's an increase of 150% from the purchase price, regardless of the restoration, it's 200k.\n\nHmm. I think the key is whether the increase is on the original purchase price or on the current value after restoration. Since the problem mentions that he invested in restoration, it's likely that the increase is on top of that. So, the 150% increase is on the 130k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not, because 150% is a significant jump. If he bought it for 80k and increased by 150%, so 80k + 120k = 200k, that's still a 150% increase. Alternatively, if it's 150% increase from the restored value, 130k becomes 325k.\n\nWait, maybe the question is in French, so perhaps I can look for similar problems or standard interpretations. In French, when they say \"la valeur augmente de X%\", it usually means an increase on the original value, not the current value unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, for example, if something was worth 100 and increases by 50%, it becomes 150. So, in that case, \"augmenter de 50%\" would be adding 50% of the original value.\n\nTherefore, in this problem, \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%\" would mean that the value increases by 150% of the original purchase price, which was 80,000.\n\nSo, 150% of 80,000 is 120,000, so the new value is 200,000.\n\nTherefore, Josh's profit would be the new value minus his total investment, which was 130,000.\n\nSo, 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000.\n\nTherefore, his profit is 70,000.\n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe the increase is from the current value after restoration. So, he bought it for 80k, spent 50k, so the current value is 130k. Then, the value increases by 150%, so 150% of 130k is 195k. So, the new value is 130k + 195k = 325k. So, profit is 325k - 130k = 195k.\n\nSo, which is it? Hmm.\n\nI think the key is to understand that when they say the value increases by 150%, unless specified otherwise, it's usually from the original value. So, in that case, it's 150% of 80k, making the new value 200k, so profit is 70k.\n\nBut in this case, he has invested 50k into restoration, so maybe the increase is on the current value, which is 130k. So, 150% increase on 130k.\n\nWait, let's think about it in terms of real estate. When you buy a property and renovate it, the value after renovation is higher, but the increase is not necessarily based on the purchase price. So, if the value increases by 150%, it's likely referring to the current value after restoration.\n\nSo, in that case, the 150% increase is on 130k, so 150% of 130k is 195k, so the new value is 130k + 195k = 325k. So, the profit is 325k - 130k = 195k.\n\nAlternatively, if it's 150% of the purchase price, he just made 70k profit.\n\nBut, I think in most problems, when they say the value increases by a percentage without specifying, it's from the original value. So, in that case, 150% of 80k, which is 120k added, making it 200k, so profit is 70k.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the problem expects the increase to be on the total investment.\n\nWait, let's check the wording again. It says: \"Josh se lance dans la rénovation d'une maison. Il en achète une au prix de 80 000 $ et investit 50 000 $ dans sa restauration. La valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150 %. Quel bénéfice a-t-il réalisé ?\"\n\nThe key here is \"alors de 150%\", which is after the restoration. So, maybe the increase is from the restored value. So, the current value after restoration is 130k, and it increases by 150%, so 130k * 2.5 = 325k.\n\nTherefore, profit would be 325k - 130k = 195k.\n\nBut another way, if the increase is from the original purchase price, it's 80k * 2.5 = 200k. So, profit is 200k - 130k = 70k.\n\nSo, which interpretation is correct?\n\nIn French, \"augmenter de\" generally refers to an increase over the original value. So, for example, \"le prix a augmenté de 20%\" means the price went up by 20%, i.e., 20% of the original price.\n\nBut in this case, the original value is 80k, but he has spent 50k on restoration, so the value after restoration might be considered as the new base.\n\nWait, perhaps not. The problem says he bought it for 80k, invested 50k, and then the value increased by 150%. So, the increase is after his investment, but does that mean the increase is on the investment amount or on the original price?\n\nHmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think about another similar problem. Suppose someone buys a car for 20k, spends 5k on repairs, and then the value increases by 50%. What's the profit? Is the increase on the original 20k or on the 25k?\n\nIn most cases, I think the increase is on the original value unless specified otherwise. So, 50% of 20k is 10k, so new value is 30k, so profit is 30k - 25k = 5k.\n\nAlternatively, if the increase is on the 25k, then 50% of 25k is 12.5k, so new value is 37.5k, profit is 12.5k.\n\nSo, which one is correct? I think it's the former, because the increase is usually on the original value unless it's stated otherwise.\n\nBut in this case, the context is renovation, so maybe the value is increased based on the investment.\n\nWait, the problem says \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%\", so it's after the restoration. So, maybe the increase is on the restored value, which is 130k.\n\nTherefore, the increase is 150% of 130k, which is 195k, so new value is 325k, profit is 195k.\n\nAlternatively, if it's 150% of the original 80k, then new value is 200k, profit is 70k.\n\nHmm. Since the problem says \"alors de 150%\", which is after the restoration, it's possible that the increase is on the restored value.\n\nBut in French, \"augmenter de\" is generally an increase over the original amount. So, \"augmenter de 150%\" would mean adding 150% of the original value.\n\nSo, if the original value was 80k, then the increase is 120k, making the new value 200k.\n\nTherefore, profit is 200k - 130k = 70k.\n\nBut now, I feel like I'm going in circles. Both interpretations are possible.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the increase is given as a percentage, so if it's 150%, that's a multiplier of 1.5 times. So, if it's on the original value, 80k * 1.5 = 120k, but that would be the increase, not the total value. Wait, no, 150% increase would mean 100% + 150% = 250%, so 80k * 2.5 = 200k.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a 150% markup on the cost, then the selling price would be 130k * 2.5 = 325k.\n\nBut in French, \"augmenter de 150%\" is ambiguous whether it's an increase of 150% (i.e., total becomes 250%) or a multiplication factor of 1.5.\n\nWait, no, in French, \"augmenter de 150%\" means an increase of 150% of the original amount, so the new value is 100% + 150% = 250% of the original.\n\nTherefore, if the original is 80k, new value is 200k.\n\nBut if the original is considered as the value after restoration, which is 130k, then the new value is 130k * 2.5 = 325k.\n\nSo, depending on which original value we take.\n\nSince the problem first mentions the purchase price, and then the restoration investment, and then the increase, it's a bit unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the increase is on the total investment, meaning 150% of 130k, so 195k profit. But that can't be, because profit is selling price minus cost, which would be 130k + 195k - 130k = 195k.\n\nAlternatively, if the selling price is 130k + 195k = 325k, then profit is 195k.\n\nBut in French, when they say \"augmenter de 150%\", it's an increase of 150% of the original value.\n\nSo, original value is 80k, so increase is 120k, new value is 200k, profit is 70k.\n\nAlternatively, if the original value is 130k, then increase is 195k, new value is 325k, profit is 195k.\n\nSo, which is it? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the original value is 80k, so the increase is 150% of 80k, so 120k, making the new value 200k, so profit is 70k.\n\nBut if the 150% increase is on the total investment, then it's 195k profit.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%\". The word \"alors\" is after the restoration. So, perhaps the increase is on the restored value.\n\nTherefore, the restored value is 130k, and the increase is 150% of that, so 195k, making the new value 325k, so profit is 195k.\n\nAlternatively, the increase is 150% of the original, so 200k, profit is 70k.\n\nI think in this case, since the increase happens \"alors\" (then), after the restoration, it's referring to the increased value after the restoration. So, the increase is on the restored value.\n\nTherefore, the new value is 130k + 150% of 130k = 325k, so profit is 195k.\n\nWait, but \"augmenter de 150%\" is an increase of 150%, so 150% of the value. So, if the value is 130k, then 150% of that is 195k, so the new value is 325k.\n\nTherefore, profit is 325k - 130k = 195k.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct interpretation.\n\nTherefore, Josh's profit is $195,000.\n\nWait, but let me check with the problem again.\n\n\"Josh se lance dans la rénovation d'une maison. Il en achète une au prix de 80 000 $ et investit 50 000 $ dans sa restauration. La valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150 %. Quel bénéfice a-t-il réalisé ?\"\n\nSo, he bought it for 80k, invested 50k, then the value increased by 150%. So, the increase is after the investment.\n\nTherefore, the increase is on the current value, which is 80k + 50k = 130k.\n\nSo, 150% increase on 130k, so 130k * 2.5 = 325k.\n\nTherefore, profit is 325k - 130k = 195k.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $195,000 profit.\n\nBut wait, 150% increase is 1.5 times the original, but sometimes people say \"augmenter de 150%\" as in adding 150%, so total is 250%.\n\nWait, in French, \"augmenter de 150%\" is the same as \"an increase of 150%\", which is the amount added, not the total. So, if the original is 100, an increase of 150% would make it 250.\n\nBut in some contexts, people say \"augmenter de 150%\" to mean multiplying by 1.5.\n\nWait, no, in French, \"augmenter de 150%\" is an increase of 150%, so the total is 100% + 150% = 250%.\n\nSo, for example, if something was 100, and it increases by 150%, it becomes 250.\n\nSo, in this case, if the original value was 80k, then the new value is 80k + 150% of 80k = 80k + 120k = 200k.\n\nBut if the original value is considered after restoration, which is 130k, then the new value is 130k + 150% of 130k = 130k + 195k = 325k.\n\nSo, depending on which original value we take.\n\nBut since the problem says \"la valeur de la maison augmente alors de 150%\", and \"alors\" refers to after the restoration, I think the original value for the increase is after the restoration, which is 130k.\n\nTherefore, 130k + 150% of 130k = 325k, so profit is 325k - 130k = 195k.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $195,000.\n\nAlternatively, if the increase is on the purchase price, it's 70k, but I think the correct interpretation is on the restored value.\n\nTherefore, I will go with $195,000 profit.\n\n**Final Answer**\nLe bénéfice réalisé par Josh est de \\boxed{195000} dollars.", "answer_pred": "Josh achète une maison pour 80 000 $ et investit 50 000 $ dans sa restauration.

{"idx": 3, "question": "Jacques fait des séries de 3 sprints 3 fois par semaine. Il court 60 mètres à chaque sprint. Au total, combien de mètres court-il par semaine ?", "answer": "540", "raw_response": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: Jacques does 3 sets of sprints 3 times a week. Each sprint is 60 meters. How many meters does he run in total per week? Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. It's about calculating the total distance Jacques runs each week. He does sprints, which are short runs, and it's given that each sprint is 60 meters. The structure is 3 sets of sprints, and he does this 3 times a week. So, I need to find out how many meters he covers in a week.\n\nAlright, let's parse the information:\n\n- Number of sets per session: 3\n- Number of sprint sessions per week: 3\n- Distance per sprint: 60 meters\n\nWait, hold on. So, each sprint is 60 meters, and he does 3 sets of these. Does that mean he runs 3 sprints each time he trains? Or is it 3 sets, each consisting of multiple sprints? Hmm, the wording says \"séries de 3 sprints\". In French, \"série\" can mean a set, like in gym terminology. So, each \"série\" is 3 sprints. So, per training session, he does 3 sets, each set being 3 sprints. So, that would be 3 sets multiplied by 3 sprints per set, right?\n\nBut wait, the original question is in French: \"Jacques fait des séries de 3 sprints 3 fois par semaine.\" So, \"séries de 3 sprints\" – that translates to \"sets of 3 sprints.\" So, each time he trains, he does 3 sets, each set being 3 sprints. Therefore, per training session, he does 3 sets × 3 sprints per set. So, 9 sprints per session.\n\nBut each sprint is 60 meters. So, per sprint, it's 60 meters. So, per session, he does 9 sprints, each 60 meters. So, 9 × 60 meters per session. Then, he does this 3 times a week. So, total per week is 3 sessions × 9 sprints per session × 60 meters per sprint.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe \"séries de 3 sprints\" means 3 sprints in total per session, not 3 sets of 3? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous in translation. In French, \"séries\" usually refers to sets, so each set is 3 sprints. So, if he does 3 sets, each with 3 sprints, that would be 9 sprints per session.\n\nBut maybe it's different. Maybe \"séries de 3 sprints\" means 3 sprints per session, and he does that 3 times a week. So, 3 sprints × 3 sessions = 9 sprints, each 60 meters. So, 9 × 60 = 540 meters.\n\nWait, but that interpretation might not be accurate because \"séries\" typically implies multiple sets. So, in fitness, a \"série\" is a set, and you do multiple sets. So, if he does \"des séries de 3 sprints,\" that would mean multiple sets, each set being 3 sprints. So, if he does 3 sets of 3 sprints, that's 9 sprints per session.\n\nBut the problem says he does this 3 fois par semaine, so 3 times a week. So, 9 sprints per session × 3 sessions = 27 sprints per week. Each sprint is 60 meters, so 27 × 60 meters. Let's compute that.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to parse it again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Jacques fait des séries de 3 sprints 3 fois par semaine. Il court 60 mètres à chaque sprint. Au total, combien de mètres court-il par semaine ?\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- \"des séries de 3 sprints\" – sets of 3 sprints\n- \"3 fois par semaine\" – 3 times a week\n- \"60 mètres à chaque sprint\" – 60 meters per sprint\n- \"Au total, combien de mètres court-il par semaine ?\" – In total, how many meters does he run per week?\n\nSo, per session, he does \"des séries de 3 sprints.\" So, if he does 3 sets of 3 sprints, that's 9 sprints per session. Then, he does this 3 times a week. So, total sprints per week: 9 × 3 = 27 sprints.\n\nEach sprint is 60 meters, so total distance: 27 × 60 meters.\n\nCalculating that: 27 × 60. Let's compute that.\n\n27 × 60: 27 × 6 is 162, so 162 × 10 is 1620. So, 1620 meters per week.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. 27 sprints of 60 meters each week. That's 1620 meters, which is 1.62 kilometers. Hmm, that seems plausible for sprint training.\n\nAlternatively, if \"séries de 3 sprints\" just means 3 sprints total per session, then per session, he does 3 sprints, each 60 meters. So, 3 × 60 = 180 meters per session. Then, 3 sessions per week: 180 × 3 = 540 meters per week.\n\nBut, given that \"séries\" implies multiple sets, I think the first interpretation is more accurate. So, 3 sets of 3 sprints each, 3 times a week.\n\nBut let's think about it in another way. Maybe \"séries de 3 sprints\" is just 3 sprints per session, and he does that 3 times a week. So, 3 sprints × 3 sessions = 9 sprints. 9 × 60 = 540 meters.\n\nBut the question is in French, so the exact phrasing is important. \"Fait des séries de 3 sprints 3 fois par semaine.\" So, \"fait des séries de 3 sprints\" – he does sets of 3 sprints, and he does this 3 times a week. So, per week, he does 3 sets of 3 sprints, but wait, 3 fois par semaine, so 3 times a week, each time doing \"des séries de 3 sprints.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps per session, he does \"des séries de 3 sprints,\" which would be multiple sets of 3 sprints. So, if he does 3 sets per session, each set being 3 sprints, and he does this 3 times a week, that would be 9 sprints per session × 3 sessions = 27 sprints, 27 × 60 = 1620 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if per session he does 3 sprints, and he does that 3 times a week, that's 9 sprints, 9 × 60 = 540 meters.\n\nWhich interpretation is correct? In French, \"séries\" in the context of exercise usually refers to sets. So, \"des séries de 3 sprints\" would mean multiple sets, each consisting of 3 sprints. So, for example, if he does 3 sets of 3 sprints, that's 9 sprints per session.\n\nBut how many sets does he do per session? The problem says \"des séries de 3 sprints 3 fois par semaine.\" So, it's a bit ambiguous. It could mean that he does 3 sets of 3 sprints, 3 times a week. Or, he does 3 sprints in a set, 3 times a week.\n\nWait, maybe another way to interpret it: he does \"des séries de 3 sprints\" each time he trains, and he trains 3 times a week. So, how many sprints per session? If \"séries de 3 sprints\" is 3 sprints, then he does 3 sprints per session, 3 times a week: 9 sprints total. But if \"séries de 3 sprints\" is multiple sets, each of 3 sprints, and he does that 3 times a week, then it's 3 sets × 3 sprints × 3 sessions.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps the sentence is structured as \"il fait des séries de 3 sprints, 3 fois par semaine.\" So, \"il fait des séries de 3 sprints\" – he does sets of 3 sprints, and he does this 3 times a week. So, per week, he does 3 sets of 3 sprints. So, 3 sets × 3 sprints = 9 sprints per week. Then, 9 × 60 meters = 540 meters.\n\nBut that seems a bit low. Alternatively, if each session he does 3 sets of 3 sprints, and he does 3 sessions a week, then it's 3 sets × 3 sprints × 3 sessions = 27 sprints, 27 × 60 = 1620 meters.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe looking at the structure of the sentence: \"Jacques fait des séries de 3 sprints 3 fois par semaine.\" So, \"fait des séries de 3 sprints\" is the action, and \"3 fois par semaine\" is the frequency.\n\nSo, \"des séries de 3 sprints\" is plural, so it's multiple sets of 3 sprints. So, if he does \"des séries\" each time he trains, and he trains 3 times a week, then each training session would consist of multiple sets, each of 3 sprints.\n\nBut how many sets per session? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe we're supposed to assume that each time he trains, he does 3 sets of 3 sprints, making 9 sprints per session, times 3 sessions, so 27 sprints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"des séries de 3 sprints\" is just 3 sprints per session, and he does that 3 times a week, leading to 9 sprints.\n\nWait, in French, when you say \"faire des séries,\" it often implies doing multiple sets. So, \"faire des séries de 3 sprints\" would mean doing several sets, each consisting of 3 sprints. So, if he does this 3 times a week, it would mean that each time he trains, he does multiple sets of 3 sprints.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify how many sets per session, maybe we're supposed to assume that each training session consists of 3 sets of 3 sprints. So, 3 sets × 3 sprints = 9 sprints per session, times 3 sessions = 27 sprints per week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"3 fois par semaine\" applies to the number of sprints, but that seems less likely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is saying that he does 3 sets of 3 sprints each, and he does that 3 times a week. So, 3 sets × 3 sprints = 9 sprints per session, times 3 sessions = 27 sprints, 27 × 60 = 1620 meters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 3 sprints per set, and 3 sets per session, 3 sessions per week: 3×3×3=27 sprints.\n\nBut maybe the problem is simpler. Maybe \"3 sprints\" per session, 3 sessions per week: 3×3=9 sprints, 9×60=540 meters.\n\nBut given the use of \"séries,\" which implies sets, I think the first interpretation is more likely, leading to 27 sprints and 1620 meters.\n\nWait, let's think about it in terms of multiplication. The problem is asking for the total meters per week. So, per sprint: 60 meters.\n\nNumber of sprints per week: ?\n\nIf he does 3 sets of 3 sprints, 3 times a week, that's 3 sets × 3 sprints × 3 sessions = 27 sprints.\n\nAlternatively, 3 sprints per set, 3 sets per session, 3 sessions per week: 3×3×3=27.\n\nBut if \"séries de 3 sprints\" is just 3 sprints per session, 3 sessions per week: 3×3=9.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused because both interpretations are possible.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it in terms of the wording: \"des séries de 3 sprints 3 fois par semaine.\" So, he does sets of 3 sprints, and he does this 3 times a week. So, \"this\" refers to \"des séries de 3 sprints,\" which is plural, so sets of 3 sprints. So, how many sets does he do each time? It's not specified. So, perhaps, the problem is assuming that each time he trains, he does 3 sets of 3 sprints.\n\nSo, per session: 3 sets × 3 sprints = 9 sprints.\n\nWeekly: 9 sprints × 3 sessions = 27 sprints.\n\nTotal meters: 27 × 60 = 1620.\n\nAlternatively, if \"3 fois par semaine\" modifies \"séries,\" meaning he does 3 sets of 3 sprints per week, then 3 sets × 3 sprints = 9 sprints, 9 × 60 = 540.\n\nBut that seems less likely because usually, when you say \"faire des séries ... 3 fois par semaine,\" it means you do the sets 3 times a week, i.e., each time you train, you do the sets.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the correct interpretation is:\n\n- Per training session: 3 sets of 3 sprints.\n- Number of training sessions per week: 3.\n- Therefore, total sprints per week: 3 sets/session × 3 sprints/set × 3 sessions/week = 27 sprints.\n- Each sprint: 60 meters.\n- Total distance: 27 × 60 = 1620 meters.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1620 meters per week.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check the other interpretation:\n\nIf \"des séries de 3 sprints 3 fois par semaine\" means he does 3 sprints 3 times a week, so 9 sprints total, then 9 × 60 = 540 meters. But that seems less likely because \"séries\" implies multiple sets.\n\nAlternatively, if it's 3 sets of 3 sprints per week, so 9 sprints total, 9 × 60 = 540.\n\nBut since he does \"3 fois par semaine,\" it's more natural to interpret that as 3 training sessions per week, each consisting of multiple sets.\n\nTherefore, sticking with the first interpretation: 3 sets of 3 sprints per session, times 3 sessions, so 27 sprints, 27 × 60 = 1620 meters.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nJacques court \\boxed{1620} mètres par semaine.\n</think>\n\nJacques fait des séries de 3 sprints 3 fois par semaine.

But if \"séries de 3 sprints\" is multiple sets, each of 3 sprints, and he does that 3 times a week, then it's 3 sets × 3 sprints × 3 sessions.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps the sentence is structured as \"il fait des séries de 3 sprints, 3 fois par semaine.\" So, \"il fait des séries de 3 sprints\" – he does sets of 3 sprints, and he does this 3 times a week. So, per week, he does 3 sets of 3 sprints. So, 3 sets × 3 sprints = 9 sprints per week. Then, 9 × 60 meters = 540 meters.\n\nBut that seems a bit low. Alternatively, if each session he does 3 sets of 3 sprints, and he does 3 sessions a week, then it's 3 sets × 3 sprints × 3 sessions = 27 sprints, 27 × 60 = 1620 meters.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe looking at the structure of the sentence: \"Jacques fait des séries de 3 sprints 3 fois par semaine.\" So, \"fait des séries de 3 sprints\" is the action, and \"3 fois par semaine\" is the frequency.\n\nSo, \"des séries de 3 sprints\" is plural, so it's multiple sets of 3 sprints. So, if he does \"des séries\" each time he trains, and he trains 3 times a week, then each training session would consist of multiple sets, each of 3 sprints.\n\nBut how many sets per session? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe we're supposed to assume that each time he trains, he does 3 sets of 3 sprints, making 9 sprints per session, times 3 sessions, so 27 sprints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"des séries de 3 sprints\" is just 3 sprints per session, and he does that 3 times a week, leading to 9 sprints.\n\nWait, in French, when you say \"faire des séries,\" it often implies doing multiple sets. So, \"faire des séries de 3 sprints\" would mean doing several sets, each consisting of 3 sprints. So, if he does this 3 times a week, it would mean that each time he trains, he does multiple sets of 3 sprints.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify how many sets per session, maybe we're supposed to assume that each training session consists of 3 sets of 3 sprints. So, 3 sets × 3 sprints = 9 sprints per session, times 3 sessions = 27 sprints per week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"3 fois par semaine\" applies to the number of sprints, but that seems less likely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is saying that he does 3 sets of 3 sprints each, and he does that 3 times a week. So, 3 sets × 3 sprints = 9 sprints per session, times 3 sessions = 27 sprints, 27 × 60 = 1620 meters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 3 sprints per set, and 3 sets per session, 3 sessions per week: 3×3×3=27 sprints.\n\nBut maybe the problem is simpler. Maybe \"3 sprints\" per session, 3 sessions per week: 3×3=9 sprints, 9×60=540 meters.\n\nBut given the use of \"séries,\" which implies sets, I think the first interpretation is more likely, leading to 27 sprints and 1620 meters.\n\nWait, let's think about it in terms of multiplication. The problem is asking for the total meters per week. So, per sprint: 60 meters.\n\nNumber of sprints per week: ?\n\nIf he does 3 sets of 3 sprints, 3 times a week, that's 3 sets × 3 sprints × 3 sessions = 27 sprints.\n\nAlternatively, 3 sprints per set, 3 sets per session, 3 sessions per week: 3×3×3=27.\n\nBut if \"séries de 3 sprints\" is just 3 sprints per session, 3 sessions per week: 3×3=9.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused because both interpretations are possible.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it in terms of the wording: \"des séries de 3 sprints 3 fois par semaine.\" So, he does sets of 3 sprints, and he does this 3 times a week. So, \"this\" refers to \"des séries de 3 sprints,\" which is plural, so sets of 3 sprints. So, how many sets does he do each time? It's not specified. So, perhaps, the problem is assuming that each time he trains, he does 3 sets of 3 sprints.\n\nSo, per session: 3 sets × 3 sprints = 9 sprints.\n\nWeekly: 9 sprints × 3 sessions = 27 sprints.\n\nTotal meters: 27 × 60 = 1620.\n\nAlternatively, if \"3 fois par semaine\" modifies \"séries,\" meaning he does 3 sets of 3 sprints per week, then 3 sets × 3 sprints = 9 sprints, 9 × 60 = 540.\n\nBut that seems less likely because usually, when you say \"faire des séries ... 3 fois par semaine,\" it means you do the sets 3 times a week, i.e., each time you train, you do the sets.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the correct interpretation is:\n\n- Per training session: 3 sets of 3 sprints.\n- Number of training sessions per week: 3.\n- Therefore, total sprints per week: 3 sets/session × 3 sprints/set × 3 sessions/week = 27 sprints.\n- Each sprint: 60 meters.\n- Total distance: 27 × 60 = 1620 meters.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1620 meters per week.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check the other interpretation:\n\nIf \"des séries de 3 sprints 3 fois par semaine\" means he does 3 sprints 3 times a week, so 9 sprints total, then 9 × 60 = 540 meters. But that seems less likely because \"séries\" implies multiple sets.\n\nAlternatively, if it's 3 sets of 3 sprints per week, so 9 sprints total, 9 × 60 = 540.\n\nBut since he does \"3 fois par semaine,\" it's more natural to interpret that as 3 training sessions per week, each consisting of multiple sets.\n\nTherefore, sticking with the first interpretation: 3 sets of 3 sprints per session, times 3 sessions, so 27 sprints, 27 × 60 = 1620 meters.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nJacques court \\boxed{1620} mètres par semaine.", "answer_pred": "Jacques fait des séries de 3 sprints 3 fois par semaine.

{"idx": 5, "question": "Kylar se rend au magasin afin d'acheter des verres pour son nouvel appartement. Un verre coûte 5 $, mais chaque deuxième verre ne coûte que 60 % du prix. Kylar veut acheter 16 verres. Combien devra-t-il payer pour les acheter ?", "answer": "64", "raw_response": "Okay, so Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses for his new apartment. Each glass normally costs $5, but every second glass is only 60% of that price. Hmm, let me figure out how much he'll have to pay in total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the pricing structure. So, for every two glasses he buys, the first one is full price, and the second one is discounted. That means every pair of glasses costs the price of one full glass plus one discounted glass. Let me write this down.\n\nThe full price is $5. The discount is 60%, so the discounted price is 60% of $5. To calculate that, I can do 0.6 multiplied by 5, which is 3. So, the second glass costs $3.\n\nTherefore, for every two glasses, he pays $5 + $3 = $8. Now, since he wants 16 glasses, I can figure out how many such pairs he needs to buy.\n\n16 glasses divided by 2 equals 8 pairs. Each pair costs $8, so 8 pairs would cost 8 multiplied by 8, which is 64. So, does that mean he pays $64 in total?\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If each pair is $8, then 8 pairs should indeed be 8 times 8, which is 64. Hmm, that seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total cost by considering each glass individually. So, for the first glass, it's $5, the second is $3, the third is $5, the fourth is $3, and so on. Since there are 16 glasses, that's 8 sets of two glasses each. Each set costs $8, so 8 sets would be 8 times 8, which is 64. So that confirms the same total.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe calculating how many glasses are full price and how many are discounted. Since every second glass is discounted, in 16 glasses, how many are full price and how many are discounted?\n\nStarting from the first glass, every odd-numbered glass is full price, and every even-numbered glass is discounted. So, in 16 glasses, there are 8 odd-numbered glasses and 8 even-numbered glasses. So, 8 glasses at $5 and 8 glasses at $3.\n\nCalculating that: 8 times 5 is 40, and 8 times 3 is 24. Adding those together, 40 plus 24 is 64. So again, the total is $64.\n\nWait, that's consistent with the previous methods. So, seems like $64 is the correct total. But let me just think about it again to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nIf he buys two glasses, it's $8. So for 16 glasses, which is 8 pairs, that's 8 times 8, which is 64. Alternatively, 16 divided by 2 is 8, so 8 pairs, each pair is $8, so 8 times 8 is 64. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the average price per glass. Since every two glasses cost $8, the average per glass is 8 divided by 2, which is $4. So, 16 glasses times $4 per glass is 64. So that's another way to confirm.\n\nHmm, so all these methods are leading me to the same answer, which is $64. So, I think that's the correct amount Kylar has to pay.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Full price per glass: $5\n- Discounted price per glass: 60% of $5 = $3\n- For every two glasses: $5 + $3 = $8\n- Number of pairs in 16 glasses: 16 / 2 = 8\n- Total cost: 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64\n\nYep, that all adds up correctly. I don't think I missed anything here. The key was recognizing that every second glass is discounted, so every pair of glasses is cheaper than buying two at full price. Calculating the cost per pair and then multiplying by the number of pairs gives the total amount.\n\nAlternatively, breaking it down into individual glasses, figuring out how many are full and how many are discounted, and then calculating each separately also gives the same result. So, either method works, but both lead to $64.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is the total discount he's getting. Without any discount, 16 glasses would cost 16 * 5 = $80. With the discount, he's saving on every second glass. Each discounted glass is $5 - $3 = $2 cheaper. So, for 8 discounted glasses, he saves 8 * $2 = $16. So, total cost is $80 - $16 = $64. That's another method, and it also gives the same answer.\n\nSo, whether I calculate the total cost directly, or subtract the discounts from the total, I end up with the same amount.

Si Seattle a 20 moutons, combien de moutons Toulouse, Charleston et Seattle ont-ils au total ?\"\n\nAlright, so translating that into English: \"Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many as Seattle. If Seattle has 20 sheep, how many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have in total?\"\n\nHmm, okay, so we have three cities: Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle. Each has a certain number of sheep, and the problem relates their quantities through multiplication factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that Seattle has 20 sheep. That's straightforward. So, let's note that down.\n\nSeattle: 20 sheep.\n\nNext, it says Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20, then Charleston must have 4 multiplied by 20. Let me calculate that.\n\nCharleston = 4 × Seattle\nCharleston = 4 × 20\nCharleston = 80 sheep.\n\nOkay, so Charleston has 80 sheep. That seems right.\n\nThen, the problem states that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, if Charleston has 80 sheep, then Toulouse must have 2 multiplied by 80.\n\nToulouse = 2 × Charleston\nToulouse = 2 × 80\nToulouse = 160 sheep.\n\nAlright, so Toulouse has 160 sheep. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together. So, I need to add up the number of sheep each city has.\n\nTotal sheep = Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle\nTotal sheep = 160 + 80 + 20\n\nLet me do that addition step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, 160 plus 80 is 240.\n\n240 plus 20 is 260.\n\nSo, altogether, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 260 sheep.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting from Seattle: 20 sheep. Okay.\n\nCharleston has four times as many as Seattle, so 4 × 20 is 80. That seems right.\n\nToulouse has twice as many as Charleston, so 2 × 80 is 160.

Charleston has four times as many as Seattle. If Seattle has 20 sheep, how many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have in total?\"\n\nHmm, okay, so we have three cities: Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle. Each has a certain number of sheep, and the problem relates their quantities through multiplication factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that Seattle has 20 sheep. That's straightforward. So, let's note that down.\n\nSeattle: 20 sheep.\n\nNext, it says Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20, then Charleston must have 4 multiplied by 20. Let me calculate that.\n\nCharleston = 4 × Seattle\nCharleston = 4 × 20\nCharleston = 80 sheep.\n\nOkay, so Charleston has 80 sheep. That seems right.\n\nThen, the problem states that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, if Charleston has 80 sheep, then Toulouse must have 2 multiplied by 80.\n\nToulouse = 2 × Charleston\nToulouse = 2 × 80\nToulouse = 160 sheep.\n\nAlright, so Toulouse has 160 sheep. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together. So, I need to add up the number of sheep each city has.\n\nTotal sheep = Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle\nTotal sheep = 160 + 80 + 20\n\nLet me do that addition step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, 160 plus 80 is 240.\n\n240 plus 20 is 260.\n\nSo, altogether, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 260 sheep.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting from Seattle: 20 sheep.

Hmm, she's downloading at 2 GB per minute. That sounds pretty fast! First, I should probably figure out how long it takes her to download 40% of the file because that's when Windows decides to restart. \n\nSo, 40% of 200 GB is... let me calculate that. 40% is the same as 0.4, so 0.4 multiplied by 200 GB. That should be 80 GB. Okay, so she downloads 80 GB before the restart. \n\nNow, at 2 GB per minute, how many minutes does that take? Well, if she's downloading 2 GB every minute, then 80 GB divided by 2 GB per minute is 40 minutes. So, she spends 40 minutes downloading before the interruption.\n\nThen, Windows restarts for 20 minutes. That's a mandatory update, so she can't do anything about that. So, she has to wait 20 minutes before she can resume downloading. But wait, when she restarts her computer, does she have to download from the beginning again? The problem says she has to \"recommencer le téléchargement depuis le début,\" which means she has to start over. Oh no, that's not good. So, she can't resume where she left off; she has to start from 0% again. \n\nSo, effectively, she's lost the 80 GB she had downloaded, and she has to download the entire 200 GB again.

So, unfortunately, she has to start over. \n\nAlternatively, is there any way she can minimize the time lost? Maybe she could download the remaining 60% after the restart. But the problem specifically says she has to restart and then download from the beginning. So, no, she can't do that.\n\nTherefore, the total time is 40 minutes of initial download, 20 minutes of restart, and 100 minutes of re-downloading the entire file.

Il essaie de rentrer en 4 heures, mais perd les 2 premières heures dans les embouteillages.

Quelle distance le sépare de son domicile à la fin des 4 heures ?", "answer": "45", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Jean is driving for 3 hours at 60 mph, then he turns around because he forgot something important at home. He tries to get back home in 4 hours, but gets stuck in traffic for the first 2 hours. Then, for the next half hour, he drives at 30 mph, and finally drives at 80 mph for the remaining time. We need to find the distance he is from his home after these 4 hours.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the problem into parts. Let me start by calculating how far Jean got away from home before he realized he forgot something. He drove for 3 hours at 60 mph. So, distance is speed multiplied by time. So, that would be:\n\nDistance away = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\nSo, he is 180 miles away from home when he decides to turn around.\n\nNow, he wants to get back home in 4 hours, but there are some complications. Let me outline the timeline of his return trip:\n\n1. First 2 hours: stuck in traffic. I assume that means he isn't moving during this time, right? So, his speed is 0 mph for the first 2 hours.\n\n2. Next half hour (0.5 hours): he drives at 30 mph.\n\n3. Remaining time: after the first 2.5 hours, he has 1.5 hours left (since 4 - 2.5 = 1.5). During this time, he drives at 80 mph.\n\nSo, let's calculate how much distance he covers in each segment of his return trip.\n\nFirst segment: 2 hours at 0 mph. So, distance covered = 0 mph * 2 hours = 0 miles.\n\nSecond segment: 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.\n\nThird segment: 1.5 hours at 80 mph. Distance = 80 * 1.5. Let me compute that. 80 * 1 = 80, and 80 * 0.5 = 40, so total is 80 + 40 = 120 miles.\n\nSo, total distance covered on his way back is 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.\n\nBut he was 180 miles away from home when he started back. So, the distance he still needs to cover is 180 - 135 = 45 miles.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I did that correctly. He was 180 miles away, and he managed to cover 135 miles on his way back. So, he is still 45 miles away from home after the 4 hours, right?\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when dealing with directions and distances, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nHe initially went 180 miles away. Then, on the way back, he covered 135 miles. So, subtracting, 180 - 135 = 45 miles. So, yes, he is 45 miles away from home.\n\nWait, but does the problem say he's trying to get back in 4 hours, but is he able to do that? Wait, no, it says he \"essaie de rentrer en 4 heures, mais perd les 2 premières heures dans les embouteillages.\" So, he attempts to return in 4 hours but gets stuck in traffic for the first 2 hours. So, he only has 2 hours left after that? Wait, no, he's trying to return in 4 hours, but loses the first 2 hours in traffic, so he has 2 hours left? Wait, but in the problem, it says \"pendant le temps restant sur les 4 heures.\" So, it's 4 hours total, with the first 2 hours stuck, then 0.5 hours at 30 mph, then the remaining time at 80 mph.\n\nSo, the remaining time after 2.5 hours is 1.5 hours, which is correct. So, that's how we got 120 miles for the last segment.\n\nSo, overall, 15 + 120 = 135 miles, so he's 45 miles away.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that he is trying to go back home, so the direction is reversed. But since he only covered 135 miles out of the 180, he's still 45 miles away.\n\nLet me just think if there's another way to interpret the problem. Maybe the 4 hours is the total time he spends trying to return, but he only manages to cover 135 miles in that time, so he's 45 miles away.

So, the problem says that for the first 40 hours, she gets paid $10 per hour. Then, any hours beyond that, which are called overtime or heures supplémentaires, she gets paid 1.2 times her normal rate. She worked 45 hours this week. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many hours are considered regular and how many are overtime. Since the first 40 are regular, that leaves 45 minus 40, which is 5 hours of overtime. Got that.\n\nNow, let me calculate her regular pay. That should be 40 hours multiplied by $10 per hour. So, 40 times 10 is... let me do the math. 40 x 10 is 400. So, her regular pay is $400.\n\nNext, I need to calculate her overtime pay. She gets 1.2 times her normal rate for those extra hours. Her normal rate is $10, so 1.2 times 10 is... 12. So, her overtime rate is $12 per hour. She worked 5 hours of overtime, so that would be 5 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 5 x 12 is 60. So, her overtime pay is $60.\n\nTo find her total earnings for the week, I just need to add her regular pay and her overtime pay together. That would be $400 plus $60. Let me add that. 400 + 60 equals 460. So, her total salary for the week is $460.\n\nWait, let me double-check in case I made a mistake. So, 40 hours at $10 is indeed $400.

So, the problem says that for the first 40 hours, she gets paid $10 per hour. Then, any hours beyond that, which are called overtime or heures supplémentaires, she gets paid 1.2 times her normal rate. She worked 45 hours this week. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many hours are considered regular and how many are overtime. Since the first 40 are regular, that leaves 45 minus 40, which is 5 hours of overtime. Got that.\n\nNow, let me calculate her regular pay. That should be 40 hours multiplied by $10 per hour. So, 40 times 10 is... let me do the math. 40 x 10 is 400. So, her regular pay is $400.\n\nNext, I need to calculate her overtime pay. She gets 1.2 times her normal rate for those extra hours. Her normal rate is $10, so 1.2 times 10 is... 12. So, her overtime rate is $12 per hour. She worked 5 hours of overtime, so that would be 5 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 5 x 12 is 60. So, her overtime pay is $60.\n\nTo find her total earnings for the week, I just need to add her regular pay and her overtime pay together. That would be $400 plus $60. Let me add that. 400 + 60 equals 460. So, her total salary for the week is $460.\n\nWait, let me double-check in case I made a mistake. So, 40 hours at $10 is indeed $400. Then, 5 hours multiplied by $12 is $60. Adding them together is $460. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here.

Le nombre de téléchargements au cours du deuxième mois était trois fois supérieur à celui du premier mois. Il a ensuite diminué de 30 % au cours du troisième mois. Combien de fois au total le programme a-t-il été téléchargé au cours de ces trois mois ?", "answer": "366", "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many times this program was downloaded over three months. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nIn the first month, it was downloaded 60 times. That's straightforward. Then, in the second month, the number of downloads was three times higher than the first month. Hmm, okay, so that means I need to multiply 60 by 3. Let me write that down:\n\nFirst month: 60 downloads.\n\nSecond month: 3 times the first month. So, 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.\n\nAlright, so far, total downloads after two months would be 60 + 180 = 240. But wait, we need to consider the third month as well.\n\nIn the third month, the downloads decreased by 30%. Now, I need to figure out what that means. A decrease of 30% from what? It must be from the second month's downloads, right? So, the third month's downloads are 30% less than the second month's. \n\nLet me calculate 30% of the second month's downloads. The second month had 180 downloads, so 30% of 180 is... 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the downloads decreased by 54.\n\nTherefore, the third month's downloads would be 180 - 54 = 126.\n\nWait, is there another way to think about this? Sometimes, people get confused whether the decrease is from the original or the previous month. In this case, since it says \"diminué de 30%\" which translates to \"decreased by 30%\", so that should be 30% of the previous month's number, which is 180. So, yes, 54 less, so 126.\n\nNow, to find the total downloads over the three months, I need to add up the downloads from each month: first, second, and third.\n\nFirst month: 60\n\nSecond month: 180\n\nThird month: 126\n\nSo, total downloads = 60 + 180 + 126.\n\nLet me do that addition step by step. 60 + 180 is 240, and 240 + 126 is 366.\n\nWait, let me double-check that because sometimes when adding numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\n60 + 180: 60 + 180 is 240. That seems right.\n\n240 + 126: Let me break that down. 240 + 100 is 340, and then +26 is 366. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding them all together gives a total of 366 downloads over three months.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst month: 60.\n\nSecond month: 3 times first month = 60 * 3 = 180.\n\nThird month: Decrease of 30% from the second month. So, 180 - (0.3 * 180) = 180 - 54 = 126.\n\nTotal: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.\n\nYes, that all checks out. I don't think I missed anything here. The problem was pretty straightforward, but it's always good to double-check each step to avoid any calculation errors.\n\nJust to make sure, let me calculate the third month another way. Instead of subtracting 30%, I can think of it as 70% of the second month's downloads, since 100% - 30% = 70%. So, 0.7 * 180 = 126. Yep, same result. That confirms that the third month's downloads are indeed 126.\n\nSo, adding all three months:\n\n60 (first) + 180 (second) + 126 (third) = 366.\n\nTherefore, the program was downloaded a total of 366 times over the three months.\n\nJust to visualize it, let me write it as:\n\nMonth 1: 60\n\nMonth 2: 60 * 3 = 180\n\nMonth 3: 180 * 0.7 = 126\n\nTotal: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.\n\nYep, everything adds up. I think that's solid. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's always good to confirm each step, especially when dealing with percentages because they can sometimes be tricky.\n\nAnother way to look at the total is to sum up the monthly downloads:\n\n- First month: 60\n\n- Second month: 180, which is 3 times 60.\n\n- Third month: 126, which is 70% of 180.\n\nAlternatively, you can think of the total as:\n\n60 + 3*60 + (3*60)*0.7\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n60 + 180 + 126 = 366.\n\nEither way, same result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough.

And finally, 6 douzaines of petits gâteaux au fromage at 55 dollars per dozen. So, to find the total cost, I need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then add them all together.\n\nLet me start with the beignets. She bought 3 dozen at 68 dollars each. So, I can calculate that by multiplying 3 by 68. Let me do that: 3 times 68. Hmm, 3 times 60 is 180, and 3 times 8 is 24, so adding those together gives me 180 + 24 = 204. So, the beignets cost 204 dollars.\n\nNext, the petits gâteaux. She bought 2 dozen at 80 dollars each. So, that's 2 multiplied by 80. 2 times 80 is straightforward, that's 160. So, the little cakes cost 160 dollars.\n\nNow, the cheese cakes. She bought 6 dozen at 55 dollars each. So, 6 times 55.

L'arrosage et la nutrition de l'arbre coûtent 3 $ par an. Combien d'années faudra-t-il à Carlos pour commencer à gagner de l'argent avec son citronnier ?", "answer": "13", "raw_response": "Okay, so Carlos wants to plant a lemon tree. The initial cost is $90. Every year, the tree will produce 7 lemons, each sold for $1.50. But he also has to spend $3 each year on watering and fertilizing the tree. The question is, how many years will it take for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree?\n\nAlright, let me break this down. First, the initial investment is $90. That's a one-time cost. Then, every year, he has some income and some expenses. So each year, he'll make money from selling lemons and spend money on maintaining the tree.\n\nLet me figure out the annual profit. If he sells 7 lemons at $1.50 each, that should be 7 multiplied by 1.50. Let me compute that: 7 times 1 is 7, and 7 times 0.50 is 3.50, so in total, that's $10.50 per year from the lemons.\n\nBut he also has to spend $3 each year on watering and fertilizing. So, his net profit each year would be the income minus the expenses. That would be $10.50 minus $3, which is $7.50 per year.\n\nSo, each year, Carlos makes a net profit of $7.50. But he initially spent $90. So, he needs to make back that $90 before he starts making a profit overall.\n\nTo find out how many years it will take to break even, I can divide the initial cost by the annual net profit. So, that's $90 divided by $7.50 per year. Let me compute that: 90 divided by 7.5.\n\nHmm, 7.5 goes into 90 how many times? Let me think. 7.5 times 12 is 90 because 7.5 times 10 is 75, and 7.5 times 2 is 15, so 75 plus 15 is 90. So, that means it will take 12 years to break even.\n\nWait, so after 12 years, he will have made back his initial $90 investment. So, starting from year 13, he will begin to make a profit each year because his net profit each year is $7.50, and he's already covered the initial cost.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me represent this with an equation to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nLet’s denote the number of years as n. The total cost is the initial cost plus the annual maintenance cost times n. The total revenue is the annual income times n. The profit should be total revenue minus total cost. We want to find the smallest n where profit is greater than zero.\n\nSo,\n\nTotal Revenue = 10.50 * n\n\nTotal Cost = 90 + 3 * n\n\nProfit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = 10.50n - (90 + 3n) = (10.50 - 3)n - 90 = 7.50n - 90\n\nWe want Profit > 0:\n\n7.50n - 90 > 0\n\n7.50n > 90\n\nn > 90 / 7.50\n\nn > 12\n\nSo, n must be greater than 12. Since n must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a year in this context), n = 13.\n\nTherefore, Carlos will start making a profit in the 13th year.\n\nBut wait, let me check the calculation again. Because 7.50 times 12 is 90, which would make profit zero. So, in the 12th year, he breaks even. So, in the 13th year, he makes $7.50 profit, which is his first profit.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the problem as when does the cumulative profit become positive, then it's after 12 full years, he recovers his initial investment, and from the 13th year onward, he's making money.\n\nAlternatively, if we think in terms of cash flows, the initial outflow is $90, and each year there's an inflow of $10.50 and an outflow of $3. So, net cash flow each year is $7.50. So, cumulative cash flow after n years is 7.50n - 90.\n\nWe want cumulative cash flow > 0, so 7.50n - 90 > 0 => n > 12. So, yeah, n must be 13.\n\nAlternatively, is the question asking when he starts making a profit, meaning when his total revenue exceeds his total cost? If so, then it's at n = 13.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to interpret it. Maybe the total money he has after n years is total revenue minus total cost. So, when does that become positive?\n\nSo, total revenue after n years is 10.50n, total cost is 90 + 3n. So, profit is 10.50n - (90 + 3n) = 7.50n - 90.\n\nWe set 7.50n - 90 > 0, so n > 12.\n\nSo, at n = 13, he's in the positive.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thinks that each year's profit is net, so after the first year, he's at -90 + 7.50 = -82.50; after the second year, -82.50 + 7.50 = -75; and so on. So, each year he reduces his deficit by $7.50. So, starting at -90, after 12 years, he would have -90 + 12*7.50 = -90 + 90 = 0. So, after 12 years, he's broken even. Then, in the 13th year, he adds another 7.50, making it positive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 13 years.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 12 years would bring him to break even, so he hasn't started making a profit yet. The next year, the 13th, he starts making a profit. So, yes, 13 years is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes in these problems, people might consider the payback period as the time when cumulative cash flows turn positive, which is at n = 12. But since at n =12, cumulative is exactly zero, so strictly speaking, he starts making profit in the 13th year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 13 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\nIl faudra à Carlos \\boxed{13} années pour commencer à gagner de l'argent avec son citronnier.\n</think>\n\nCarlos veut planter un citronnier avec un coût initial de 90 $. Chaque année, l'arbre produit 7 citrons vendus à 1,50 $ pièce, générant un revenu de 10,50 $ par an.

The initial cost is $90. Every year, the tree will produce 7 lemons, each sold for $1.50. But he also has to spend $3 each year on watering and fertilizing the tree. The question is, how many years will it take for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree?\n\nAlright, let me break this down. First, the initial investment is $90. That's a one-time cost. Then, every year, he has some income and some expenses. So each year, he'll make money from selling lemons and spend money on maintaining the tree.\n\nLet me figure out the annual profit. If he sells 7 lemons at $1.50 each, that should be 7 multiplied by 1.50. Let me compute that: 7 times 1 is 7, and 7 times 0.50 is 3.50, so in total, that's $10.50 per year from the lemons.\n\nBut he also has to spend $3 each year on watering and fertilizing. So, his net profit each year would be the income minus the expenses. That would be $10.50 minus $3, which is $7.50 per year.\n\nSo, each year, Carlos makes a net profit of $7.50. But he initially spent $90. So, he needs to make back that $90 before he starts making a profit overall.\n\nTo find out how many years it will take to break even, I can divide the initial cost by the annual net profit. So, that's $90 divided by $7.50 per year. Let me compute that: 90 divided by 7.5.\n\nHmm, 7.5 goes into 90 how many times? Let me think. 7.5 times 12 is 90 because 7.5 times 10 is 75, and 7.5 times 2 is 15, so 75 plus 15 is 90. So, that means it will take 12 years to break even.\n\nWait, so after 12 years, he will have made back his initial $90 investment. So, starting from year 13, he will begin to make a profit each year because his net profit each year is $7.50, and he's already covered the initial cost.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me represent this with an equation to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nLet’s denote the number of years as n. The total cost is the initial cost plus the annual maintenance cost times n. The total revenue is the annual income times n. The profit should be total revenue minus total cost. We want to find the smallest n where profit is greater than zero.\n\nSo,\n\nTotal Revenue = 10.50 * n\n\nTotal Cost = 90 + 3 * n\n\nProfit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = 10.50n - (90 + 3n) = (10.50 - 3)n - 90 = 7.50n - 90\n\nWe want Profit > 0:\n\n7.50n - 90 > 0\n\n7.50n > 90\n\nn > 90 / 7.50\n\nn > 12\n\nSo, n must be greater than 12. Since n must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a year in this context), n = 13.\n\nTherefore, Carlos will start making a profit in the 13th year.\n\nBut wait, let me check the calculation again. Because 7.50 times 12 is 90, which would make profit zero. So, in the 12th year, he breaks even.

So, net cash flow each year is $7.50. So, cumulative cash flow after n years is 7.50n - 90.\n\nWe want cumulative cash flow > 0, so 7.50n - 90 > 0 => n > 12. So, yeah, n must be 13.\n\nAlternatively, is the question asking when he starts making a profit, meaning when his total revenue exceeds his total cost? If so, then it's at n = 13.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to interpret it. Maybe the total money he has after n years is total revenue minus total cost.

Lors de son passage à la maison verte, elle a vendu un tiers de ses aspirateurs, puis 2 autres à la maison rouge, et enfin la moitié de ce qui restait à la maison orange. S'il reste à Mélanie 5 aspirateurs, de combien d'aspirateurs disposait-elle au départ ?", "answer": "18", "raw_response": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, Mélanie is selling vacuum cleaners door-to-door. She starts with a certain number, let's call that number X. Then she goes to the green house, sells a third of her vacuum cleaners there. After that, she goes to the red house and sells 2 more. Then she goes to the orange house and sells half of what's left. In the end, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. We need to figure out how many she started with.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as X. \n\nFirst, at the green house, she sells a third of her vacuum cleaners. So, she sells (1/3)X. That means she has the remaining two-thirds left after that. So, after the green house, she has (2/3)X vacuum cleaners.\n\nNext, she goes to the red house and sells 2 more. So, she subtracts 2 from the remaining (2/3)X. So, after the red house, she has (2/3)X - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nThen, she goes to the orange house and sells half of what's left. So, she sells half of (2/3)X - 2, which would be [(2/3)X - 2]/2. That means she has the other half left after the orange house. So, after the orange house, she has [(2/3)X - 2]/2 left.\n\nAccording to the problem, after all these transactions, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n[(2/3)X - 2]/2 = 5\n\nNow, let's solve this equation step by step.\n\nFirst, let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n(2/3)X - 2 = 10\n\nNext, add 2 to both sides:\n\n(2/3)X = 12\n\nNow, to solve for X, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2:\n\nX = 12 * (3/2) = 18\n\nWait, so X is 18? Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 18 vacuum cleaners.\n\nAt the green house, she sells a third, which is 6. So, 18 - 6 = 12 left.\n\nThen, she sells 2 more at the red house: 12 - 2 = 10 left.\n\nAt the orange house, she sells half of what's left, so half of 10 is 5. So, she sells 5, and has 5 left.\n\nYes, that matches the problem statement. So, she started with 18 vacuum cleaners.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the math just to be sure.\n\nWe had the equation:\n\n[(2/3)X - 2]/2 = 5\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(2/3)X - 2 = 10\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n\n(2/3)X = 12\n\nMultiply both sides by 3/2:\n\nX = 18\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Mélanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.\n\nAlternatively, let's try another approach working backwards, just to confirm.\n\nShe ends up with 5 vacuum cleaners after selling half at the orange house. So, before selling at the orange house, she must have had 10 vacuum cleaners because selling half of 10 leaves her with 5.\n\nBefore the orange house, she had 10. This was after selling 2 at the red house. So, before selling 2 at the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.\n\nBefore the red house, she had 12. This was after selling a third at the green house. So, if 12 is the two-thirds remaining after selling a third, then the original number must be 12 divided by (2/3), which is 12 * (3/2) = 18.\n\nYep, that also gives us 18.

Hmm, let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many students are in contemporary and jazz, then subtract that from the total to find out how many are in hip-hop. After that, I can convert that number into a percentage. That makes sense.\n\nAlright, starting with contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students. To find 20% of 20, I can calculate 20% multiplied by 20. In math terms, that's 0.20 * 20. Let me compute that. 0.20 times 20 is... 4. So, 4 students are in contemporary dance.\n\nNext, jazz dance: 25% of 20 students. Similarly, that would be 0.25 * 20.

Both methods gave me the same answer, so I feel confident that 55% is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is \\boxed{55\\%}.", "answer_pred": "First, we calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance. \n\n- For contemporary dance: \\(20\\%\\) of 20 students is \\(0.20 \\times 20 = 4\\) students.\n- For jazz dance: \\(25\\%\\) of 20 students is \\(0.25 \\times 20 = 5\\) students.\n\nNext, we find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:\n\n\\[ 20 - 4 - 5 = 11 \\]\n\nTo find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula for percentage:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{11}{20} \\right) \\times 100 = 55\\% \\]\n\nThus, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is \\(\\boxed{55\\%}\\).", "exact_match": 0.0}

Son conseiller financier spécule sur une hausse de 2,5 % du marché des bijoux et de 1,2 % de celui des gadgets électroniques au cours du même mois. Si le commerçant fait un choix qui lui permet de maximiser son profit à la fin du mois, quel serait le montant de ce profit ?", "answer": "125", "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which investment option the merchant should choose to maximize his profit at the end of the month. He has two options: buying jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000. The financial advisor predicts a 2.5% increase in the jewelry market and a 1.2% increase in the electronic gadgets market. \n\nFirst, I think I should calculate the expected profit from each investment separately. Profit would be the increase in value, right? So for each option, I can find the amount of increase by multiplying the initial value by the expected percentage increase. Then, I can compare the two profits to see which one is larger.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nFor jewelry:\n- Initial value: $5,000\n- Expected increase: 2.5%\nSo, the profit from jewelry would be 5,000 multiplied by 2.5%.\n\nFor electronic gadgets:\n- Initial value: $8,000\n- Expected increase: 1.2%\nSo, the profit from gadgets would be 8,000 multiplied by 1.2%.\n\nHmm, I should remember to convert the percentage into decimal form for the multiplication. So, 2.5% is 0.025, and 1.2% is 0.012.\n\nCalculating the jewelry profit:\n$5,000 * 0.025 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 5,000 times 0.025. Well, 5,000 times 0.01 is 50, so 0.025 is a quarter of that? Wait, no, 0.025 is 2.5%, which is 2.5 per 100. So another way, 5,000 divided by 100 is 50, so 2.5 times 50 is 125. So, profit is $125.\n\nNow, for the gadgets:\n$8,000 * 0.012 = ?\n\nAgain, breaking it down. 8,000 times 0.01 is 80, so 0.012 is 1.2 times that, which is 80 * 1.2. 80 times 1 is 80, and 80 times 0.2 is 16, so total is 96. So, the profit is $96.\n\nSo, comparing the two profits: $125 from jewelry and $96 from gadgets. Clearly, $125 is higher than $96, so the merchant should choose the jewelry investment to maximize his profit.\n\nWait a second, but should I consider the total amount after the increase as well? Because sometimes, people might get confused between profit and total amount. But in this case, the question specifically mentions profit, so profit is just the increase, not the total value. So, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute the total value for both as well.\n\nFor jewelry:\n$5,000 + $125 = $5,125\n\nFor gadgets:\n$8,000 + $96 = $8,096\n\nComparing $5,125 and $8,096, the total value of gadgets is higher, but the question is about profit. So, the difference from the initial investment is $125 vs. $96.\n\nTherefore, the merchant should go with the jewelry because it provides a higher profit of $125 compared to $96 from gadgets.\n\nWait, but another thought: is the initial investment amount considered in the profit? Like, if he invests $5,000 vs. $8,000, shouldn't the profit be compared relative to the investment? Maybe in terms of return on investment (ROI), rather than absolute profit.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify anything about ROI or percentage return; it just asks for the profit amount. So, even though the absolute profit from jewelry is higher, maybe it's because the initial investment was lower. But since the question doesn't mention anything about the risk or the amount of investment, just to maximize profit, regardless of the initial investment.\n\nWait, let me re-read the question:\n\n\"Si le commerçant fait un choix qui lui permet de maximiser son profit à la fin du mois, quel serait le montant de ce profit ?\"\n\nSo, translation: \"If the merchant makes a choice that allows him to maximize his profit at the end of the month, what would be the amount of this profit?\"\n\nSo, it's about maximizing the profit, not considering the initial investment. So, even though he is investing less in jewelry, the profit is higher than in gadgets. So, from a purely profit-maximizing standpoint, regardless of the amount invested, he should choose jewelry because the expected profit is higher.\n\nAlternatively, if he had to choose based on ROI, it's a different story. Let's calculate that too, just to see.\n\nROI for jewelry: (Profit / Investment) * 100 = (125 / 5,000) * 100 = 2.5%\n\nROI for gadgets: (96 / 8,000) * 100 = 1.2%\n\nSo, in terms of ROI, jewelry is better, which makes sense because the percentage increase was higher for jewelry. But since the question is about the profit amount, which is the actual dollar amount, not the percentage, the answer is $125.\n\nI think that's solid.

Le jour suivant, ils voyagent vers le nord, couvrant 150 miles. Quelle est la distance parcourue par chaque train au cours de ces deux jours ?", "answer": "230", "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem about two trains leaving San Rafael at the same time. They first go west and cover 80 miles each. Then the next day, they travel north, covering 150 miles. I need to find the total distance each train has traveled over these two days. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the journey. Both trains start from the same point, San Rafael. On the first day, they go west for 80 miles. So, imagine a map where San Rafael is the starting point, and both trains move west, which is to the left on the map. After the first day, they've each gone 80 miles west.\n\nThe next day, they change direction and go north. North is upwards on the map, so they're now moving in a perpendicular direction from where they were on the first day. They cover 150 miles north. So, each train is moving 150 miles in the north direction from their position after the first day.\n\nI need to find the total distance each train has traveled. Wait, is the question asking for the total distance or the straight-line distance from the starting point? The wording says, \"Quelle est la distance parcourue par chaque train au cours de ces deux jours?\" which translates to \"What is the distance traveled by each train over these two days?\" So, distance traveled would mean the total path they took, not the straight-line distance from start to finish.\n\nSo, if that's the case, each train went west 80 miles and then north 150 miles. So, the total distance would just be the sum of these two legs. That is, 80 miles plus 150 miles.\n\nLet me calculate that: 80 + 150. That equals 230 miles. So, each train has traveled a total of 230 miles over the two days.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says \"distance parcourue,\" which in French can sometimes mean displacement, but in this context, since they specify \"au cours de ces deux jours,\" I think it's referring to the total distance traveled, not displacement. Because displacement would be the straight-line distance from the start to the end point, which is different.\n\nSo, displacement would be the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 80 miles and 150 miles. But the question is about distance parcourue, which is the actual path taken. So, it's 80 + 150, which is 230 miles.\n\nJust to double-check, if it had been displacement, we would calculate it using the Pythagorean theorem: sqrt(80^2 + 150^2). Let me see what that gives. 80 squared is 6400, and 150 squared is 22500. Adding them together gives 28900. The square root of 28900 is 170. So, displacement would be 170 miles, but that's not what the question is asking.\n\nTherefore, the total distance each train traveled is 230 miles.\n\nI might be overcomplicating this, but just to be thorough. Each day, they move in a different direction, west and then north, which are perpendicular. So, their paths form a right angle. But since we're just adding the distances, regardless of direction, it's straightforward addition.\n\nAnother way to think about it: On day one, both trains go 80 miles west. That's 80 miles each. On day two, each goes 150 miles north. So, for each train, the total distance is 80 + 150. Since both trains follow the same path, both have the same total distance.\n\nSo, yeah, 80 + 150 is 230 miles. That seems right.\n\nI wonder if there's any trick or something I'm missing here.

Si elle travaille 35 heures par semaine en tant qu'enseignante, 15 heures par semaine comme entraineuse et 50 semaines par an, quel est son salaire annuel ?", "answer": "57500", "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out Jill's annual salary based on her two jobs. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, she works as an enseignante, which I think means teacher, and she earns $20 per hour. She also works as an entraineuse de majorettes, which I believe translates to majorettes coach. For that job, she makes $30 per hour. \n\nAlright, so she has two different hourly rates for two different jobs. I need to calculate how much she earns each week from each job and then multiply that by the number of weeks she works in a year to get her annual salary.\n\nLet me write down the given information:\n\n- Hourly wage as a teacher: $20/hour\n- Hours worked per week as a teacher: 35 hours\n- Hourly wage as a majorettes coach: $30/hour\n- Hours worked per week as a coach: 15 hours\n- Number of weeks worked per year: 50 weeks\n\nSo, first, I should calculate her weekly earnings from each job separately.\n\nFor the teaching job: she works 35 hours a week at $20 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from teaching would be 35 hours multiplied by $20. Let me do that calculation:\n\n35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week\n\nOkay, so she makes $700 each week from teaching.\n\nNow, for the coaching job: she works 15 hours a week at $30 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from coaching would be 15 hours multiplied by $30. Calculating that:\n\n15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week\n\nGot it, so she makes an additional $450 each week from coaching.\n\nNow, to find her total weekly earnings from both jobs, I need to add those two amounts together:\n\n$700/week (teaching) + $450/week (coaching) = $1,150/week\n\nSo, she makes $1,150 each week in total.\n\nNext, since we want her annual salary, we need to multiply her weekly earnings by the number of weeks she works in a year. She works 50 weeks per year. So, that would be:\n\n$1,150/week * 50 weeks/year\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, 1,150 multiplied by 50. Well, 1,000 multiplied by 50 is 50,000, and 150 multiplied by 50 is 7,500. So, adding those together:\n\n$50,000 + $7,500 = $57,500\n\nTherefore, her annual salary would be $57,500.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make an error. So, 35 hours times $20 is indeed $700, and 15 times $30 is $450. Adding those gives $1,150 per week. Then, 50 weeks times $1,150.\n\nBreaking it down, 50 weeks is almost a full year, except for maybe two weeks of vacation or something. But regardless, the calculation is 50 times 1,150.\n\nSo, another way to calculate 1,150 multiplied by 50 is to recognize that 50 is the same as 5 times 10. So, 1,150 times 10 is 11,500, and then times 5 is 57,500. Yep, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have calculated the annual earnings for each job separately and then added them together. Let me try that method just to confirm.\n\nFor the teaching job: 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week. Then, $700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year.\n\nFor the coaching job: 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week. Then, $450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year.\n\nAdding those two amounts together: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500/year.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, that gives me more confidence that $57,500 is the correct annual salary.\n\nI think that's all the steps. I considered both jobs separately, calculated the weekly earnings, then multiplied by the number of weeks in the year. I also double-checked by calculating each job's annual contribution and then adding them. Both methods gave me the same answer, so I feel pretty certain about it.\n\n**Final Answer**\nJill's annual salary is \\boxed{57500} dollars.\n</think>\n\nJill gagne 20 $ de l'heure en tant qu'enseignante et 30 $ comme entraineuse de majorettes.

I need to calculate how much she earns each week from each job and then multiply that by the number of weeks she works in a year to get her annual salary.\n\nLet me write down the given information:\n\n- Hourly wage as a teacher: $20/hour\n- Hours worked per week as a teacher: 35 hours\n- Hourly wage as a majorettes coach: $30/hour\n- Hours worked per week as a coach: 15 hours\n- Number of weeks worked per year: 50 weeks\n\nSo, first, I should calculate her weekly earnings from each job separately.\n\nFor the teaching job: she works 35 hours a week at $20 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from teaching would be 35 hours multiplied by $20. Let me do that calculation:\n\n35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week\n\nOkay, so she makes $700 each week from teaching.\n\nNow, for the coaching job: she works 15 hours a week at $30 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from coaching would be 15 hours multiplied by $30. Calculating that:\n\n15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week\n\nGot it, so she makes an additional $450 each week from coaching.\n\nNow, to find her total weekly earnings from both jobs, I need to add those two amounts together:\n\n$700/week (teaching) + $450/week (coaching) = $1,150/week\n\nSo, she makes $1,150 each week in total.\n\nNext, since we want her annual salary, we need to multiply her weekly earnings by the number of weeks she works in a year. She works 50 weeks per year. So, that would be:\n\n$1,150/week * 50 weeks/year\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, 1,150 multiplied by 50. Well, 1,000 multiplied by 50 is 50,000, and 150 multiplied by 50 is 7,500. So, adding those together:\n\n$50,000 + $7,500 = $57,500\n\nTherefore, her annual salary would be $57,500.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make an error. So, 35 hours times $20 is indeed $700, and 15 times $30 is $450. Adding those gives $1,150 per week. Then, 50 weeks times $1,150.\n\nBreaking it down, 50 weeks is almost a full year, except for maybe two weeks of vacation or something. But regardless, the calculation is 50 times 1,150.\n\nSo, another way to calculate 1,150 multiplied by 50 is to recognize that 50 is the same as 5 times 10. So, 1,150 times 10 is 11,500, and then times 5 is 57,500. Yep, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have calculated the annual earnings for each job separately and then added them together. Let me try that method just to confirm.\n\nFor the teaching job: 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week. Then, $700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year.\n\nFor the coaching job: 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week. Then, $450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year.\n\nAdding those two amounts together: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500/year.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, that gives me more confidence that $57,500 is the correct annual salary.\n\nI think that's all the steps. I considered both jobs separately, calculated the weekly earnings, then multiplied by the number of weeks in the year. I also double-checked by calculating each job's annual contribution and then adding them. Both methods gave me the same answer, so I feel pretty certain about it.\n\n**Final Answer**\nJill's annual salary is \\boxed{57500} dollars.", "answer_pred": "Jill gagne 20 $ de l'heure en tant qu'enseignante et 30 $ comme entraineuse de majorettes.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider how many eggs she uses each day. She uses 3 eggs per omelet, and she makes one every morning. So that's 3 eggs per day. Got that.\n\nNext, I should figure out how many days are in 4 weeks. Well, a week has 7 days, so 4 weeks would be 4 multiplied by 7. Let me calculate that: 4 × 7 = 28 days. So, Claire will be eating her omelet for 28 days.\n\nNow, if she uses 3 eggs each day, over 28 days, the total number of eggs she'll consume is 3 eggs/day multiplied by 28 days. Let me do that multiplication: 3 × 28. Hmm, 3 × 20 is 60, and 3 × 8 is 24, so 60 + 24 equals 84. So she'll eat 84 eggs in total.\n\nBut the question asks for the number of dozen eggs. I know that one dozen equals 12 eggs. So, to find out how many dozen 84 eggs is, I need to divide 84 by 12. Let me compute that: 84 ÷ 12. Well, 12 × 7 is 84, so that means 84 eggs make up 7 dozen.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 3 eggs per day times 28 days is indeed 84 eggs. Then, 84 divided by 12 is 7. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of weeks. Since she uses 3 eggs per day, in one week (7 days), she uses 3 × 7 = 21 eggs. Then, over 4 weeks, that would be 21 × 4. Calculating that: 20 × 4 is 80, and 1 × 4 is 4, so 80 + 4 is 84 eggs. Again, 84 divided by 12 is 7 dozen. So both methods lead me to the same answer.\n\nI guess another way to approach it is by converting daily usage to dozen. Since 3 eggs is less than a dozen, maybe I can find out how many dozen she uses per day and then multiply by 28 days. But that might complicate things because 3 eggs is a fraction of a dozen. Let me see: 3 eggs is 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4 of a dozen. So, per day, she uses 1/4 dozen. Over 28 days, that would be 28 × (1/4) dozen. 28 divided by 4 is 7, so again, 7 dozen. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I calculate the total eggs first and then convert to dozen, or convert the daily usage to dozen first and then multiply by days, the answer is consistent. That gives me confidence that 7 dozen is the correct answer.\n\nI don't think I made any miscalculations here. The key steps are: daily egg consumption, total days, total eggs, then convert to dozen. All steps check out, and multiple methods lead to the same answer.

{"idx": 19, "question": "Marissa fait une randonnée sur un sentier d'une longueur de 12 miles. Elle a mis 1 heure pour parcourir les 4 premiers miles, puis une autre heure pour les deux miles suivants. Si elle veut que sa vitesse moyenne soit de 4 miles par heure, quelle vitesse (en miles par heure) doit-elle atteindre pour parcourir la distance restante ?", "answer": "6", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Marissa is hiking a trail that's 12 miles long. She's already covered some distance, and now she wants to make sure her average speed for the entire hike is 4 miles per hour. I need to find out what speed she needs to maintain for the remaining distance.\n\nFirst, let me summarize the information given:\n\n1. Total length of the trail: 12 miles.\n2. She has already hiked 4 miles in 1 hour.\n3. Then, she hiked another 2 miles in another hour.\n4. She wants her average speed for the entire hike to be 4 miles per hour.\n\nSo, I think the first thing I should do is calculate how much distance she has left to hike. She's done 4 miles and then another 2 miles, so that's 4 + 2 = 6 miles. Since the total trail is 12 miles, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. Okay, so she has 6 miles left.\n\nNext, let's figure out how much time she has already spent. She spent 1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles. So, that's 1 + 1 = 2 hours total so far.\n\nNow, she wants her average speed for the entire 12 miles to be 4 miles per hour. Average speed is calculated by total distance divided by total time. So, if her average speed is 4 mph, then the total time she should take for the entire hike is total distance divided by average speed. That would be 12 miles divided by 4 mph, which equals 3 hours. So, she wants to complete the entire hike in 3 hours.\n\nShe has already used 2 hours, so the time she has left to finish the remaining 6 miles is 3 - 2 = 1 hour. Therefore, she needs to cover the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour.\n\nTo find the required speed for the remaining distance, I can use the formula: speed = distance / time. So, the distance is 6 miles, and the time is 1 hour. Plugging that in, 6 miles divided by 1 hour equals 6 mph.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that right. So, she wants an average speed of 4 mph for 12 miles. 12 miles divided by 4 mph is 3 hours total. She has already taken 2 hours, so she has 1 hour left. She has 6 miles left, so 6 miles divided by 1 hour is indeed 6 mph. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations. She did 4 miles in 1 hour, so that's a speed of 4 mph. Then, she did 2 miles in another hour, which is a speed of 2 mph. So, her average speed so far isn't too high. She needs to compensate for the slower speed in the second segment by going faster in the remaining segment.\n\nSo, total distance: 12 miles. She's done 6 miles. Remaining: 6 miles.\n\nTotal desired time: 3 hours. She's already used 2 hours. Remaining time: 1 hour.\n\nSo, 6 miles in 1 hour is 6 mph. That makes sense. If she goes 6 mph for the last 6 miles, she'll cover that distance in 1 hour, bringing her total time to 3 hours, which gives her an average speed of 4 mph over the entire 12 miles.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by calculating the total time she's already taken and the required time for the remaining distance.\n\nTotal desired time is 3 hours. She has 1 hour left. She needs to cover 6 miles in that 1 hour, so 6 mph. Yeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for average speed. Wait, average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, if I denote the remaining speed as 'v', then her total time would be 2 hours plus the time taken for the remaining 6 miles at speed 'v'. So, time = distance / speed, which is 6 / v. Therefore, total time is 2 + (6 / v).\n\nWe want her average speed to be 4 mph, so total distance (12) divided by total time (2 + 6 / v) should equal 4 mph.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n12 / (2 + 6 / v) = 4\n\nLet me solve this equation for 'v'.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by (2 + 6 / v):\n\n12 = 4 * (2 + 6 / v)\n\n12 = 8 + 24 / v\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n4 = 24 / v\n\nMultiply both sides by v:\n\n4v = 24\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nv = 6\n\nSo, that confirms it. She needs to go at 6 mph for the remaining 6 miles.\n\nWait, let me go through that equation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with:\n\n12 / (2 + 6 / v) = 4\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n12 = 4*(2 + 6 / v)\n\n12 = 8 + 24 / v\n\nSubtract 8:\n\n4 = 24 / v\n\nMultiply both sides by v:\n\n4v = 24\n\nDivide by 4:\n\nv = 6\n\nYep, that all checks out.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about it in terms of total time: she's already used 2 hours, needs to use 3 hours in total, so 1 hour left. 6 miles in 1 hour is 6 mph.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Total distance: 12 miles\n- Distance covered: 6 miles\n- Time taken: 2 hours\n- Desired average speed: 4 mph\n- Total required time: 3 hours\n- Remaining time: 1 hour\n- Remaining distance: 6 miles\n- Required speed: 6 mph\n\nSo, yeah, the answer is 6 mph.\n\n**Final Answer**\nMarissa doit atteindre une vitesse de \\boxed{6} miles par heure pour la distance restante.\n</think>\n\nMarissa est en train de randonner sur un sentier de 12 miles.

The rest would be 10 - 20/3 = 10/3 ≈ 3.333 liters of pure orange juice.\n\nOkay, moving on. Then, there's the pineapple juice. It says 15 liters of pineapple juice, composed three-quarters of water. So, similar to the orange juice, let's calculate the water content here.\n\n- Pineapple juice: 15 liters, with 3/4 water.\n\nSo, water in pineapple juice is (3/4) * 15 = 45/4 = 11.25 liters. Therefore, the pure pineapple juice is 15 - 11.25 = 3.75 liters.\n\nNow, the plan was to mix these two juices together. So before any accident happens, let's see what the total volume would be.\n\nTotal juice before mixing: 10 liters (orange) + 15 liters (pineapple) = 25 liters. But wait, before mixing, I accidentally spill one liter of orange juice. So, we have to account for that loss.\n\nSo, the amount of orange juice left after spilling is 10 - 1 = 9 liters. That means we're mixing 9 liters of orange juice with 15 liters of pineapple juice, resulting in 9 + 15 = 24 liters of mixture. That's why the problem mentions 24 liters remaining, right?\n\nNow, the question is: how much water is in these 24 liters? So, we need to find the total water from both the orange and pineapple juices in the remaining 24 liters.\n\nLet's compute the water from the remaining orange juice first. Originally, the 10 liters of orange juice had 20/3 liters of water. But since we spilled 1 liter of orange juice, we need to figure out how much water was lost in that spill.\n\nWait, is the orange juice uniformly mixed? I think so, yes. So, when we spill 1 liter of orange juice, the proportion of water in that spilled liter is the same as in the whole 10 liters. So, the amount of water spilled is (2/3) of 1 liter, which is 2/3 liters.\n\nTherefore, the remaining water in the orange juice is 20/3 - 2/3 = 18/3 = 6 liters. So, 6 liters of water from the orange juice remains.\n\nNow, for the pineapple juice, we didn't spill any, so all its water content is still there. That's 11.25 liters, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, total water in the 24 liters mixture is water from orange juice plus water from pineapple juice: 6 + 11.25 = 17.25 liters.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, original water in orange juice: 20/3 ≈ 6.666 liters. After spilling 1 liter, which had 2/3 liters of water, so 6.666 - 0.666 = 6 liters left. Pineapple juice had 11.25 liters of water, none spilled. So, total water is 6 + 11.25 = 17.25 liters.\n\nHmm, 17.25 liters is 69/4 liters if I convert it to fractions, but maybe it's better to leave it as 17.25. Alternatively, 17.25 liters is the same as 17 liters and a quarter liter.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the concentration of water in each juice and then compute the total water after accounting for the spill.\n\nSo, for the orange juice: 2/3 water. Before spilling, 10 liters. After spilling 1 liter, 9 liters left. The amount of water in these 9 liters would be (2/3)*9 = 6 liters. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nFor the pineapple juice: 3/4 water. 15 liters, none spilled. So, water is (3/4)*15 = 11.25 liters. So, total water is 6 + 11.25 = 17.25 liters. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of ratios, maybe.\n\nBut I think that's consistent. So, the total water in the 24 liters is 17.25 liters.\n\nSo, converting 0.25 liters to milliliters is 250 milliliters, but the question just asks for the quantity in liters, so 17.25 liters is the answer.\n\nWait, 17.25 liters is equal to 69/4 liters, but that's just another way of writing it. So, unless they want it in fractions, 17.25 is fine.\n\nAlternatively, expressing it as a mixed number: 17 1/4 liters.\n\nBut in terms of the problem's context, 17.25 liters is straightforward.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n- Start with 10 liters of OJ, 2/3 water: 20/3 ≈6.666 liters water, 10 - 20/3 ≈3.333 liters OJ.\n\n- Spill 1 liter of OJ: since it's uniformly mixed, 2/3 water spilled, so 2/3 liters water lost, leaving 20/3 - 2/3 = 18/3 =6 liters water, and 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 liters of OJ lost, so 3.333 - 0.666 ≈2.666 liters OJ left.\n\n- Pineapple juice: 15 liters, 3/4 water: 11.25 liters water, 3.75 liters PJ.\n\n- Total mixture: 9 liters OJ +15 liters PJ=24 liters.\n\n- Total water:6 +11.25=17.25 liters.\n\nYes, that all adds up. So, the answer is 17.25 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe quantity of water in the remaining 24 litres is \\boxed{17.25} litres.\n</think>\n\nWe start with 10 liters of orange juice (OJ) composed of two-thirds water. The amount of water in the orange juice is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Water in OJ} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 10 = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.666 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\nWe spill 1 liter of OJ, which contains:\n\\[\n\\text{Water spilled} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ liters}\n\\]\nThus, the remaining water in the OJ is:\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nNext, we have 15 liters of pineapple juice (PJ) composed of three-quarters water. The amount of water in the pineapple juice is:\n\\[\n\\text{Water in PJ} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 15 = 11.25 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nAfter spilling 1 liter of OJ, we are left with 9 liters of OJ and 15 liters of PJ, making a total of 24 liters. The total amount of water in the remaining mixture is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total water} = 6 \\text{ liters (from OJ)} + 11.25 \\text{ liters (from PJ)} = 17.25 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nThus, the quantity of water in the remaining 24 litres is \\boxed{17.25} litres.", "thinking_pred": "Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have two types of juices here: one is orange juice and the other is pineapple juice.

Hmm, okay, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem says I have 10 liters of orange juice. But it's not pure orange juice; it's composed two-thirds of water.

Si Samantha est maintenant âgée de 31 ans, quel est l'âge du fils de Raymond ?", "answer": "14", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to figure out the age of Raymond's son. So, Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. That means Raymond is older than Samantha by 6 years. \n\nRight now, Samantha is 31 years old. Since Raymond is 6 years older, I can calculate Raymond's current age by adding 6 to Samantha's age. Let me write that down:\n\nRaymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years\nRaymond's age = 31 + 6\nRaymond's age = 37 years\n\nSo Raymond is 37 years old now. Now, the problem says that Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. I need to find out how old that son is now. \n\nTo find the son's current age, I subtract the age Raymond was when he had the son from his current age.

Raymond is 37, he had a son at 23, so 37 minus 23 is indeed 14. That seems right. \n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me think about the timeline. Samantha is 31 now, so Raymond is 37. Raymond had his son when he was 23, which was 37 - 23 = 14 years ago. So, the son was born 14 years ago, meaning he is 14 now. Yep, that checks out.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here.

Since Raymond is 6 years older, if Samantha is 31, then Raymond was born 6 years before her. So, Samantha's birth year is, let's say, 2019 (if she's 31 in 2020), then Raymond was born in 2013. Wait, no, that would make Raymond younger. Wait, no, hold on, I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, no, if Samantha is 31 now, then she was born in 2020 - 31 = 1989. Since Raymond is 6 years older, he was born in 1983. So, Raymond was born in 1983, Samantha in 1989. So, Raymond had a son when he was 23. So, 1983 + 23 = 2006. So, the son was born in 2006. Now, in 2020, the son is 2020 - 2006 = 14 years old. \n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, whether I calculate it directly by subtracting ages or by figuring out the birth years, I get the same result. So, I'm confident that the son is 14 years old.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1.

{"idx": 23, "question": "Une bougie allumée fond et perd 2 centimètres toutes les heures. Combien de centimètres la bougie aura-t-elle perdus après avoir brûlé de 13 h à 17 h ?", "answer": "8", "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem about a candle that loses 2 centimeters every hour. I need to figure out how much it will have lost between 13 h and 17 h. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I should make sure I understand the question correctly. \n\nThe candle is burning from 13 hours to 17 hours. Wait, hold on, does that mean 13 o'clock to 17 o'clock, which is 1 PM to 5 PM? Yeah, I think that's right. So, it's burning for a certain number of hours, and every hour it loses 2 centimeters. So, I need to find out how many hours that is and then multiply by 2 cm per hour to get the total loss.\n\nLet me visualize the timeline. Starting at 13:00 (1 PM), the candle begins to burn. It continues burning until 17:00 (5 PM). So, how many hours is that? Well, from 13 to 14 is one hour, 14 to 15 is another, 15 to 16 is the third, and 16 to 17 is the fourth. So, that's 4 hours in total. \n\nWait, but sometimes when we calculate time between two points, we might get confused about whether to include both start and end times. For example, from 13:00 to 14:00 is exactly one hour, right? So, from 13:00 to 17:00, that's four hours. Let me double-check that. If I start at 13:00, after one hour it's 14:00, after two hours 15:00, three hours 16:00, and four hours 17:00. Yep, four hours exactly. \n\nSo, the total time the candle is burning is four hours. Now, since it loses 2 centimeters each hour, I can calculate the total loss by multiplying the number of hours by the rate of loss. That is, 4 hours multiplied by 2 cm per hour. \n\nLet me write that out: 4 hours * 2 cm/hour. Hmm, the hours unit cancels out, leaving me with centimeters, which is what we want. So, 4 times 2 is 8. Therefore, the candle loses 8 centimeters in total. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through it again. Starting at 13:00, each hour it's losing 2 cm. So, at 14:00, it's lost 2 cm; at 15:00, another 2 cm, totaling 4 cm; at 16:00, another 2 cm, so 6 cm; and at 17:00, another 2 cm, bringing the total to 8 cm. Yep, that seems right. \n\nI think I'm confident in that answer.

{"idx": 24, "question": "Kyle a acheté le livre le plus vendu de l'année dernière à 19,50 $, en bénéficiant d'une remise de 25 % sur le prix initial. Quel est le prix initial du livre ?", "answer": "26", "raw_response": "Okay, so Kyle bought the most sold book of last year for $19.50, and he got a 25% discount on the initial price. I need to find out what the original price of the book was. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a discount means the price Kyle paid is less than the original price. Specifically, a 25% discount means Kyle paid 75% of the original price because 100% minus 25% is 75%. So, if I let the original price be a variable, say, P, then 75% of P should equal the amount Kyle paid, which is $19.50.\n\nTo write this as an equation, it would be:\n0.75 * P = 19.50\n\nNow, I need to solve for P. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75. That should isolate P on one side.\n\nSo, P = 19.50 / 0.75\n\nLet me compute that. Dividing 19.50 by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 goes into 19.50 how many times? \n\nWell, 0.75 * 26 is 19.50 because 0.75 * 20 is 15, and 0.75 * 6 is 4.50, so 15 + 4.50 is 19.50. So, 19.50 divided by 0.75 is 26.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation to be sure. Maybe I'll do it another way. \n\nIf I multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to eliminate decimals, I get:\n75 * P = 1950\n\nThen, to solve for P, divide both sides by 75:\nP = 1950 / 75\n\nCalculating that, 75 goes into 1950 how many times? 75 * 26 is 1950 because 75 * 20 is 1500 and 75 * 6 is 450, so 1500 + 450 is 1950. So, 1950 divided by 75 is 26. Yep, that confirms it.\n\nSo, the original price of the book was $26.\n\nJust to recap, Kyle paid 75% of the original price because he got a 25% discount. By setting up the equation 0.75 * P = 19.50 and solving for P, I found that the original price was $26. I checked my calculation by multiplying 0.75 by 26, which equals 19.50, so that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is if the discounted price is $19.50, which is after taking off 25%. So, $19.50 represents 75% of the original price. Therefore, to find 100%, you can divide by 0.75 or multiply by (4/3), since 75% is 3/4. \n\nLet me try that method too. If 75% is $19.50, then 1% is $19.50 divided by 75, which is $0.26. Therefore, 100% would be $0.26 * 100, which is $26. That also works and gives the same result. So, no matter which method I use, whether it's dividing by 0.75 or calculating the value of 1% and scaling up, I get $26 as the original price.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations, I'll use another approach. If I take $26 and apply a 25% discount, what do I get? \n\n25% of $26 is (25/100)*26 = 0.25*26 = $6.50. So, subtracting that from $26 gives $26 - $6.50 = $19.50, which is exactly what Kyle paid. \n\nTherefore, all methods converge to the same answer, which gives me confidence that $26 is indeed the correct original price of the book.\n\nI think I've covered all possible ways to approach this problem, and each time the result is consistent. So, I can confidently say that the original price of the book was $26.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe original price of the book was \\boxed{26} dollars.\n</think>\n\nKyle bought the most sold book of last year for $19.50 after receiving a 25% discount on the initial price.

Then, she bought 5 cartons of milk, each costing $3. So, I'll calculate the total cost for the milk. Let me write that down:\n\n5 cartons * $3/carton = $15.\n\nAlright, so the milk costs $15 in total. Next, she bought 4 apples, each at $1.50. Let's compute that:\n\n4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6.\n\nSo, the apples add up to $6.

Combien d'argent Mishka a-t-elle dépensé en tout pour l'achat de ces vêtements ?", "answer": "243", "raw_response": "Okay, let's see. Mishka bought some clothes, and I need to figure out how much she spent in total. Hmm, she bought 3 shorts, 3 pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. Each of these items has a different price. \n\nFirst, I should probably write down the costs of each item. The shorts are $16.50 each, the pants are $22.50 each, and the shoes are $42 each. So, for each type of clothing, I need to calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of items by the price per item.\n\nLet me start with the shorts. She bought 3 of them, and each is $16.50. So, I need to multiply 3 by 16.50. Let me do that: 3 times 16 is 48, and 3 times 0.50 is 1.50. So, if I add those together, 48 plus 1.50 is 49.50. So, the total cost for the shorts is $49.50. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNext, the pants. Each pair is $22.50, and she bought 3 of them. So, I need to calculate 3 times 22.50. Let me break it down: 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 2.50 is 7.50. Adding those together, 60 plus 7.50 is 67.50. So, the total cost for the pants is $67.50. Hmm, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the shoes. Each pair is $42, and she bought 3 pairs. So, 3 times 42. Hmm, 3 times 40 is 120, and 3 times 2 is 6. Adding those gives 120 plus 6, which is 126. So, the total cost for the shoes is $126.00.\n\nOkay, now I have the totals for each category: shorts at $49.50, pants at $67.50, and shoes at $126.00. I need to add all these together to find the total amount Mishka spent.\n\nLet me start by adding the shorts and the pants. So, $49.50 plus $67.50. Hmm, 49 plus 67 is 116, and 0.50 plus 0.50 is 1.00. So, 116 plus 1 is 117. So, the total for shorts and pants is $117.00.\n\nNow, I need to add the shoes, which are $126.00, to this total. So, $117.00 plus $126.00. Let me add the dollars: 117 plus 126 is... 117 plus 100 is 217, 217 plus 26 is 243. So, adding 117 and 126 gives me 243.00. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. 117 + 126. If I break it down, 100 + 100 is 200, 17 + 26 is 43, so 200 + 43 is 243. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total amount Mishka spent is $243.00.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the calculations again.\n\nFor the shorts: 3 x 16.50. 16.50 x 3. 10 x 3 = 30, 6 x 3 = 18, 0.50 x 3 = 1.50. So, 30 + 18 is 48, plus 1.50 is 49.50. Correct.\n\nFor the pants: 3 x 22.50. 20 x 3 = 60, 2.50 x 3 = 7.50. 60 + 7.50 is 67.50. Correct.\n\nFor the shoes: 3 x 42. 40 x 3 = 120, 2 x 3 = 6. 120 + 6 = 126. Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 49.50 + 67.50 = 117.00. Then, 117.00 + 126.00 = 243.00.

Mishka bought some clothes, and I need to figure out how much she spent in total. Hmm, she bought 3 shorts, 3 pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. Each of these items has a different price. \n\nFirst, I should probably write down the costs of each item. The shorts are $16.50 each, the pants are $22.50 each, and the shoes are $42 each. So, for each type of clothing, I need to calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of items by the price per item.\n\nLet me start with the shorts. She bought 3 of them, and each is $16.50. So, I need to multiply 3 by 16.50. Let me do that: 3 times 16 is 48, and 3 times 0.50 is 1.50. So, if I add those together, 48 plus 1.50 is 49.50. So, the total cost for the shorts is $49.50. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNext, the pants. Each pair is $22.50, and she bought 3 of them. So, I need to calculate 3 times 22.50. Let me break it down: 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 2.50 is 7.50. Adding those together, 60 plus 7.50 is 67.50. So, the total cost for the pants is $67.50. Hmm, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the shoes. Each pair is $42, and she bought 3 pairs. So, 3 times 42. Hmm, 3 times 40 is 120, and 3 times 2 is 6. Adding those gives 120 plus 6, which is 126. So, the total cost for the shoes is $126.00.\n\nOkay, now I have the totals for each category: shorts at $49.50, pants at $67.50, and shoes at $126.00. I need to add all these together to find the total amount Mishka spent.\n\nLet me start by adding the shorts and the pants. So, $49.50 plus $67.50. Hmm, 49 plus 67 is 116, and 0.50 plus 0.50 is 1.00. So, 116 plus 1 is 117. So, the total for shorts and pants is $117.00.\n\nNow, I need to add the shoes, which are $126.00, to this total. So, $117.00 plus $126.00. Let me add the dollars: 117 plus 126 is... 117 plus 100 is 217, 217 plus 26 is 243. So, adding 117 and 126 gives me 243.00. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. 117 + 126. If I break it down, 100 + 100 is 200, 17 + 26 is 43, so 200 + 43 is 243. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total amount Mishka spent is $243.00.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the calculations again.\n\nFor the shorts: 3 x 16.50. 16.50 x 3. 10 x 3 = 30, 6 x 3 = 18, 0.50 x 3 = 1.50. So, 30 + 18 is 48, plus 1.50 is 49.50. Correct.\n\nFor the pants: 3 x 22.50. 20 x 3 = 60, 2.50 x 3 = 7.50. 60 + 7.50 is 67.50. Correct.\n\nFor the shoes: 3 x 42. 40 x 3 = 120, 2 x 3 = 6. 120 + 6 = 126. Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 49.50 + 67.50 = 117.00. Then, 117.00 + 126.00 = 243.00.

Si la somme de leurs âges actuels est de 162, calculez l'âge qu'aura Allen dans 10 ans.", "answer": "109", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about Darell and Allen's ages. Their current ages are in the ratio of 7 to 11, and the sum of their ages is 162. We need to find out how old Allen will be in 10 years.\n\nHmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I remember that when you have a ratio, you can represent the quantities as multiples of a common value. So, if Darell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, that means we can express their ages as 7 parts and 11 parts respectively. Let me write that down:\n\nLet Darell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a common multiplier.\n\nSo, 7x is Darell's age, and 11x is Allen's age. That makes sense because if I divide their ages by x, I should get the ratio 7:11. Let me check that: (7x)/x = 7 and (11x)/x = 11. Yep, that works.\n\nNow, the sum of their ages is given as 162. So, if I add Darell's age and Allen's age together, that should equal 162. Let me write that equation:\n\n7x + 11x = 162\n\nSimplifying the left side: 7x plus 11x is 18x. So,\n\n18x = 162\n\nTo find the value of x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 18:\n\nx = 162 / 18\n\nLet me compute that. 162 divided by 18. Hmm, 18 times 9 is 162 because 18 times 10 is 180, which is too much. So, 18 times 9 is 162, so x is 9.\n\nOkay, so x equals 9. Now, I can find Darell's and Allen's current ages by plugging x back into their expressions.\n\nDarell's age is 7x, so that's 7 times 9. Let me calculate that: 7*9 is 63. So, Darell is 63 years old.\n\nAllen's age is 11x, which is 11 times 9. 11*9 is 99. So, Allen is currently 99 years old.\n\nWait, that seems a bit old, but maybe they are just really old people or maybe it's a typo? But the math checks out: 7x + 11x is 18x, 18*9 is 162, which matches the given total. So, I think that's correct.\n\nNow, the question is asking for Allen's age in 10 years. So, if Allen is currently 99, then in 10 years, he will be 99 + 10, which is 109.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to be sure. So, x is 9, Allen's current age is 11x = 99, so in 10 years, 99 + 10 is 109. That seems right.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Ratio of ages: 7:11\n- Let Darell's age = 7x, Allen's age = 11x\n- 7x + 11x = 18x = 162\n- So, x = 9\n- Allen's current age: 11*9 = 99\n- Allen's age in 10 years: 99 + 10 = 109\n\nEverything adds up. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

The sum of their ages is given as 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\n7x + 11x = 162\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\n\\[\n18x = 162\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\(x\\), we divide both sides by 18:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{162}{18} = 9\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find Allen's current age by plugging \\(x\\) back into the expression \\(11x\\):\n\n\\[\n11x = 11 \\times 9 = 99\n\\]\n\nAllen's age in 10 years will be:\n\n\\[\n99 + 10 = 109\n\\]\n\nThus, the age that Allen will be in 10 years is \\boxed{109}.", "thinking_pred": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about Darell and Allen's ages. Their current ages are in the ratio of 7 to 11, and the sum of their ages is 162. We need to find out how old Allen will be in 10 years.\n\nHmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I remember that when you have a ratio, you can represent the quantities as multiples of a common value. So, if Darell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, that means we can express their ages as 7 parts and 11 parts respectively. Let me write that down:\n\nLet Darell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a common multiplier.\n\nSo, 7x is Darell's age, and 11x is Allen's age. That makes sense because if I divide their ages by x, I should get the ratio 7:11. Let me check that: (7x)/x = 7 and (11x)/x = 11. Yep, that works.\n\nNow, the sum of their ages is given as 162. So, if I add Darell's age and Allen's age together, that should equal 162. Let me write that equation:\n\n7x + 11x = 162\n\nSimplifying the left side: 7x plus 11x is 18x. So,\n\n18x = 162\n\nTo find the value of x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 18:\n\nx = 162 / 18\n\nLet me compute that. 162 divided by 18. Hmm, 18 times 9 is 162 because 18 times 10 is 180, which is too much. So, 18 times 9 is 162, so x is 9.\n\nOkay, so x equals 9. Now, I can find Darell's and Allen's current ages by plugging x back into their expressions.\n\nDarell's age is 7x, so that's 7 times 9. Let me calculate that: 7*9 is 63. So, Darell is 63 years old.\n\nAllen's age is 11x, which is 11 times 9. 11*9 is 99. So, Allen is currently 99 years old.\n\nWait, that seems a bit old, but maybe they are just really old people or maybe it's a typo? But the math checks out: 7x + 11x is 18x, 18*9 is 162, which matches the given total. So, I think that's correct.\n\nNow, the question is asking for Allen's age in 10 years. So, if Allen is currently 99, then in 10 years, he will be 99 + 10, which is 109.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to be sure. So, x is 9, Allen's current age is 11x = 99, so in 10 years, 99 + 10 is 109. That seems right.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Ratio of ages: 7:11\n- Let Darell's age = 7x, Allen's age = 11x\n- 7x + 11x = 18x = 162\n- So, x = 9\n- Allen's current age: 11*9 = 99\n- Allen's age in 10 years: 99 + 10 = 109\n\nEverything adds up.

{"idx": 33, "question": "Gretchen a 110 pièces. Les pièces en or comptent 30 pièces de plus que celles en argent. Combien Gretchen a-t-elle de pièces en or ?", "answer": "70", "raw_response": "Alright, so I have this problem here: Gretchen has 110 pieces. The gold pieces are 30 more than the silver pieces. I need to find out how many gold pieces Gretchen has. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are two types of pieces: gold and silver. The total number of these pieces is 110. It also says that the number of gold pieces is 30 more than the number of silver pieces. So, if I let the number of silver pieces be some number, then the number of gold pieces would be that number plus 30. Got it.\n\nLet me try to translate this into mathematical expressions. Let's assign variables to make it easier. Let's say S represents the number of silver pieces. Then, according to the problem, the number of gold pieces, which I'll call G, is equal to S plus 30. So, G = S + 30.\n\nNow, we also know that the total number of pieces is 110. That means if we add the number of silver pieces and gold pieces together, we should get 110. So, S + G = 110.\n\nBut since I already expressed G in terms of S, I can substitute that into the equation. So replacing G with S + 30 in the total equation, it becomes S + (S + 30) = 110.\n\nLet me write that out again: S + (S + 30) = 110. Now, let's simplify this equation. Combining like terms, S + S is 2S, and then we have +30. So, 2S + 30 = 110.\n\nNow, I can solve for S. First, I'll subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with S. So, 2S + 30 - 30 = 110 - 30. That simplifies to 2S = 80.\n\nNext, I'll divide both sides by 2 to solve for S. So, 2S / 2 = 80 / 2, which gives S = 40. So, Gretchen has 40 silver pieces.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the number of gold pieces. So, since G = S + 30, and S is 40, then G = 40 + 30 = 70. So, Gretchen has 70 gold pieces.\n\nLet me just double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If she has 40 silver pieces and 70 gold pieces, then the total should be 40 + 70 = 110, which matches the total given in the problem. Additionally, the number of gold pieces is indeed 30 more than the silver pieces because 70 - 40 = 30. So, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this problem another way to verify. Suppose I let the number of gold pieces be G and silver pieces be S. The total is G + S = 110, and G = S + 30. So substituting the second equation into the first, (S + 30) + S = 110, which simplifies to 2S + 30 = 110, leading to S = 40. Then G = 70. It's the same result.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the difference. If there are 30 more gold pieces than silver pieces, then the difference between G and S is 30. So, the total number of pieces is 110, which is G + S. If I imagine that the number of silver pieces is equal to the base, and the gold pieces are 30 more, then effectively, if I subtract 30 from the total, the remaining 80 pieces would be equally split between the two types? Wait, no, that might not be accurate.\n\nLet me think again. If I have a total of 110 pieces and the gold is 30 more than silver, it's like having two groups where one is 30 larger. So, if I subtract the extra 30, I can think of the remaining 80 pieces as being equally divided between the two. But actually, no. Let me explain.\n\nIf I have G = S + 30, then if I subtract 30 from G, I get G - 30 = S. So, S is 30 less than G. Then, if I add G and S together, it's G + (G - 30) = 110. So, 2G - 30 = 110. Then, adding 30 to both sides, 2G = 140, so G = 70. That's the same answer as before.\n\nWait, so that's another way to approach it, by expressing S in terms of G instead of the other way around. So, that also gives G = 70.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the number of gold pieces is 70. That makes me more confident that 70 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me also think about whether this makes sense intuitively. If she has 30 more gold pieces than silver, then the number of gold pieces should be more than half of 110. Half of 110 is 55, and 70 is indeed more than that. So, 70 seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of it as a system of equations:\n\nEquation 1: G + S = 110\n\nEquation 2: G - S = 30\n\nThen, adding these two equations together, we get:\n\nG + S + G - S = 110 + 30\n\nSimplifying, 2G = 140\n\nTherefore, G = 70.\n\nSubtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:\n\nG + S - (G - S) = 110 - 30\n\nSimplifying, 2S = 80, so S = 40.\n\nThis also confirms that G is 70 and S is 40.\n\nSo, whether I approach it by substitution, by expressing one variable in terms of the other, or by using a system of equations, I consistently get the same result.

If there are 70 gold pieces and 40 silver pieces, then 70 is indeed 30 more than 40, and the total is 70 + 40 = 110. So, everything adds up.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors here. Each step logically follows, and all methods converge on the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that Gretchen has 70 gold pieces.\n\n**Final Answer**\nGretchen a \\boxed{70} pièces en or.\n</think>\n\nGretchen a 110 pièces au total.

The gold pieces are 30 more than the silver pieces. I need to find out how many gold pieces Gretchen has. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are two types of pieces: gold and silver. The total number of these pieces is 110. It also says that the number of gold pieces is 30 more than the number of silver pieces. So, if I let the number of silver pieces be some number, then the number of gold pieces would be that number plus 30. Got it.\n\nLet me try to translate this into mathematical expressions. Let's assign variables to make it easier. Let's say S represents the number of silver pieces. Then, according to the problem, the number of gold pieces, which I'll call G, is equal to S plus 30. So, G = S + 30.\n\nNow, we also know that the total number of pieces is 110. That means if we add the number of silver pieces and gold pieces together, we should get 110. So, S + G = 110.\n\nBut since I already expressed G in terms of S, I can substitute that into the equation. So replacing G with S + 30 in the total equation, it becomes S + (S + 30) = 110.\n\nLet me write that out again: S + (S + 30) = 110. Now, let's simplify this equation. Combining like terms, S + S is 2S, and then we have +30. So, 2S + 30 = 110.\n\nNow, I can solve for S. First, I'll subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with S. So, 2S + 30 - 30 = 110 - 30. That simplifies to 2S = 80.\n\nNext, I'll divide both sides by 2 to solve for S. So, 2S / 2 = 80 / 2, which gives S = 40. So, Gretchen has 40 silver pieces.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the number of gold pieces. So, since G = S + 30, and S is 40, then G = 40 + 30 = 70. So, Gretchen has 70 gold pieces.\n\nLet me just double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If she has 40 silver pieces and 70 gold pieces, then the total should be 40 + 70 = 110, which matches the total given in the problem. Additionally, the number of gold pieces is indeed 30 more than the silver pieces because 70 - 40 = 30. So, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this problem another way to verify. Suppose I let the number of gold pieces be G and silver pieces be S. The total is G + S = 110, and G = S + 30. So substituting the second equation into the first, (S + 30) + S = 110, which simplifies to 2S + 30 = 110, leading to S = 40. Then G = 70. It's the same result.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the difference. If there are 30 more gold pieces than silver pieces, then the difference between G and S is 30. So, the total number of pieces is 110, which is G + S. If I imagine that the number of silver pieces is equal to the base, and the gold pieces are 30 more, then effectively, if I subtract 30 from the total, the remaining 80 pieces would be equally split between the two types? Wait, no, that might not be accurate.\n\nLet me think again. If I have a total of 110 pieces and the gold is 30 more than silver, it's like having two groups where one is 30 larger. So, if I subtract the extra 30, I can think of the remaining 80 pieces as being equally divided between the two. But actually, no. Let me explain.\n\nIf I have G = S + 30, then if I subtract 30 from G, I get G - 30 = S. So, S is 30 less than G. Then, if I add G and S together, it's G + (G - 30) = 110. So, 2G - 30 = 110. Then, adding 30 to both sides, 2G = 140, so G = 70. That's the same answer as before.\n\nWait, so that's another way to approach it, by expressing S in terms of G instead of the other way around. So, that also gives G = 70.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the number of gold pieces is 70. That makes me more confident that 70 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me also think about whether this makes sense intuitively. If she has 30 more gold pieces than silver, then the number of gold pieces should be more than half of 110. Half of 110 is 55, and 70 is indeed more than that. So, 70 seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of it as a system of equations:\n\nEquation 1: G + S = 110\n\nEquation 2: G - S = 30\n\nThen, adding these two equations together, we get:\n\nG + S + G - S = 110 + 30\n\nSimplifying, 2G = 140\n\nTherefore, G = 70.\n\nSubtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:\n\nG + S - (G - S) = 110 - 30\n\nSimplifying, 2S = 80, so S = 40.\n\nThis also confirms that G is 70 and S is 40.\n\nSo, whether I approach it by substitution, by expressing one variable in terms of the other, or by using a system of equations, I consistently get the same result.

Then, in the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points. I need to figure out the total points he scored overall. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, during the initial 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. That part is straightforward. Now, the tricky part is figuring out how many points he scored in the next 20 minutes. The problem states that he scored 25% more points during that time. So, does that mean he scored 25% more than 4 points, or is it 25% of his total points or something else? Let me think.\n\nI believe it means he scored 25% more than the points he scored in the first 20 minutes. So, if he scored 4 points in the first half, then in the second half, he scored 4 points plus 25% of 4 points. Let me write that down:\n\nPoints in first 20 minutes: 4.\n\n25% of 4 is calculated as 0.25 * 4 = 1.\n\nSo, during the next 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.\n\nTherefore, the total points he scored would be the sum of the points from both halves. That is 4 points + 5 points = 9 points.\n\nWait a second, let me verify if that makes sense. If he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes and 25% more in the next 20 minutes, 25% of 4 is indeed 1, so that would make 5 points in the second half. So, altogether, 4 + 5 is 9 points. That seems correct.\n\nBut hold on, another way to interpret \"25% de points supplémentaires\" could be that he scored 25% more points compared to the first half. So, it's 25% more than the initial 4 points, which is 5 points, as I calculated earlier. So, yeah, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if someone misinterprets it as 25% of 4 points, which is 1 point, and then just adds that to the total, that would give 5 points, but that's actually the same as what I did before. Wait, no, if he scored 25% more, that means he scored 4 points plus 25% of 4, which is 1, so 5 points. So, in total, 4 + 5 = 9 points.\n\nAlternatively, is there another way to interpret this?

So, total is 9 points. That seems reasonable. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way could be to see the rate of scoring. In the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points. So, his scoring rate was 4 points / 20 minutes = 0.2 points per minute. Then, in the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points. So, does that mean his scoring rate increased by 25%? Or the total points increased by 25%?\n\nWait, the problem says he scored 25% more points during the next 20 minutes. So, it's about the points, not the rate. So, he scored 4 points in the first half, and 25% more points in the second half, which is 4 * 1.25 = 5 points. So, yeah, same result as before.\n\nAlternatively, if we think in terms of the rate: 0.2 points per minute. If his rate increased by 25%, then his new rate would be 0.2 * 1.25 = 0.25 points per minute. Then, over 20 minutes, he would score 0.25 * 20 = 5 points.

Combien d'argent dépense-t-il en yaourt sur 30 jours ?", "answer": "75", "raw_response": "Okay, so Terry eats 2 yogurts each day. I need to figure out how much money he spends on yogurt over 30 days. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days. If he eats 2 every day, then over 30 days, that should be 2 times 30. Let me calculate that: 2 * 30 = 60. So, Terry eats 60 yogurts in 30 days.\n\nNow, the yogurt is sold at a price of 4 for $5. That means every time Terry buys 4 yogurts, he pays $5. So, to find out how much 60 yogurts cost, I can first determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60.\n\nTo do that, I'll divide 60 by 4. Let me compute that: 60 / 4 = 15. So, there are 15 sets of 4 yogurts in 60.\n\nSince each set of 4 costs $5, I can multiply the number of sets by the cost per set to get the total cost. So, 15 sets * $5 per set. That's 15 * 5. Let me see, 15 * 5 is 75. So, that should be $75.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 2 yogurts per day times 30 days is indeed 60. Then, 60 divided by 4 is 15. 15 multiplied by $5 is $75. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by finding the cost per yogurt and then multiplying by the total number consumed. Let's see, if 4 yogurts cost $5, then each yogurt costs 5 / 4 dollars. Calculating that, 5 divided by 4 is 1.25. So each yogurt is $1.25.\n\nThen, Terry eats 60 yogurts. So, 60 * 1.25. Let me compute that: 60 * 1 is 60, and 60 * 0.25 is 15, so adding those together, 60 + 15 = 75. So, again, that gives me $75. Okay, so that method also gives me $75, which is consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any division or multiplication errors. 4 goes into 60 how many times? 4*15=60, so yes, 15 times. 15 times $5 is 75. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: If Terry buys 4 yogurts for $5, how much does he spend each day? He eats 2 yogurts a day, which is half of 4. So, half of $5 is $2.50.

So, that's another way to approach it and still get the same result.\n\nWait, so whether I calculate the total number of yogurts first, or the daily cost, I still end up with the same total amount.

I need to figure out how much money he spends on yogurt over 30 days. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days. If he eats 2 every day, then over 30 days, that should be 2 times 30. Let me calculate that: 2 * 30 = 60. So, Terry eats 60 yogurts in 30 days.\n\nNow, the yogurt is sold at a price of 4 for $5. That means every time Terry buys 4 yogurts, he pays $5. So, to find out how much 60 yogurts cost, I can first determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60.\n\nTo do that, I'll divide 60 by 4. Let me compute that: 60 / 4 = 15. So, there are 15 sets of 4 yogurts in 60.\n\nSince each set of 4 costs $5, I can multiply the number of sets by the cost per set to get the total cost. So, 15 sets * $5 per set. That's 15 * 5. Let me see, 15 * 5 is 75. So, that should be $75.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 2 yogurts per day times 30 days is indeed 60. Then, 60 divided by 4 is 15. 15 multiplied by $5 is $75. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by finding the cost per yogurt and then multiplying by the total number consumed. Let's see, if 4 yogurts cost $5, then each yogurt costs 5 / 4 dollars. Calculating that, 5 divided by 4 is 1.25. So each yogurt is $1.25.\n\nThen, Terry eats 60 yogurts. So, 60 * 1.25. Let me compute that: 60 * 1 is 60, and 60 * 0.25 is 15, so adding those together, 60 + 15 = 75. So, again, that gives me $75.

He has 13 Lego games that he's selling for $15 each. Then, he buys 8 video games at $20 each and ends up with $5 left. We need to find out how many Lego games he has left. Hmm, wait, he's selling all his toys, so does that mean he only sells some of them? Or does it mean he sells all 13? The wording says \"vendre tous ses jouets,\" which translates to \"sell all his toys.\" So, maybe he sells all 13 Lego games. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much money Jean makes from selling his Lego games. He has 13 of them, each sold for $15. So, the total money he gets is 13 multiplied by 15. Let me write that down: 13 * 15. Let me calculate that. 10*15 is 150, and 3*15 is 45, so 150 + 45 is 195. So, he makes $195 from selling his Lego games.\n\nNow, he uses this money to buy video games. Each video game costs $20, and he buys 8 of them. So, the total cost for the video games is 8 multiplied by 20. Let's calculate that: 8*20 is 160. So, he spends $160 on video games.\n\nHe ends up with $5 left. So, the money he had after selling the Legos was $195, then he spent $160, and had $5 remaining. Let's verify this: 195 - 160 is 35, but he has 5 left. Wait, that doesn't add up. 195 - 160 is 35, but he only has 5 left. So, that suggests that he didn't sell all his Lego games?

The question is how many Lego games does he have left.\n\nWait, but if he sells all his toys, including all 13 Lego games, he would have made $195, spent $160, and should have $35 left. But the problem says he has $5 left. So, that suggests he didn't sell all 13 Lego games. So, perhaps he sold only a certain number of them to get the money needed to buy the video games and have $5 left.\n\nOkay, so maybe I need to set up an equation. Let's let x be the number of Lego games he sold. Each is sold at $15, so he earns 15x dollars. He uses this money to buy 8 video games at $20 each, which costs 8*20 = $160. After buying, he has $5 left. So, the total money he had was 15x, and after spending 160, he has 5. So, the equation is:\n\n15x - 160 = 5.\n\nLet me solve this equation. 15x = 160 + 5 = 165. Therefore, x = 165 / 15. 165 divided by 15 is 11. So, he sold 11 Lego games. Since he originally had 13, the number of Lego games he has left is 13 - 11 = 2.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. If he sold 11 Lego games at $15 each, he gets 11*15 = 165. He buys 8 video games at $20 each, which is 8*20 = 160. So, 165 - 160 = 5, which matches the problem statement. Therefore, he sold 11, so he has 2 left. So, the answer is 2.\n\nBut hold on, the initial thought was he sells all his toys, which includes all 13 Lego games, but that led to inconsistency. So, maybe the problem is that he didn't sell all his toys but only enough to afford the video games and have $5 left. So, in that case, he sold 11, leaving him with 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nJean lui reste \\boxed{2} jeux de lego.\n</think>\n\nJean veut vendre ses jouets pour acheter des jeux vidéos.

Quelle est sa vitesse de course ?", "answer": "10", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to figure out Jean's running speed. Hmm, so he runs 60 miles each week and goes out three days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, and then the next two days, he runs half as much each day. I need to find his speed.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information. He runs three days a week: day 1, day 2, and day 3. On day 1, he runs for 3 hours. On days 2 and 3, he runs half the duration of day 1. So, that would be 1.5 hours each on those days, right?\n\nWait, the problem says he runs two times less on the other two days. Hmm, does that mean half the distance or half the time? I think it refers to the time because it says he \"court pendant 3 heures\" on the first day, so the time is specified. So, if he runs two times less, that would be 3 hours divided by 2, which is 1.5 hours each on the other two days.\n\nSo, total time he spends running each week is 3 hours (day 1) plus 1.5 hours (day 2) plus 1.5 hours (day 3). Let me add that up: 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 equals 6 hours total per week.\n\nHe runs 60 miles each week. So, if he runs 60 miles in 6 hours, his average speed would be distance divided by time, right? So, 60 miles divided by 6 hours equals 10 miles per hour.\n\nWait, that seems a bit fast for running. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nFirst, total time: day 1 is 3 hours. Days 2 and 3 are each half of that, so 1.5 hours each. 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 is indeed 6 hours. Total distance is 60 miles. So, 60 miles over 6 hours is 10 mph. Hmm, that's actually a pretty fast pace. Maybe he's a competitive runner?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe \"court deux fois moins\" refers to distance rather than time. Let me read it again: \"Le premier jour il court pendant 3 heures et court deux fois moins les deux autres jours.\" So, the first day he runs for 3 hours, and the other two days he runs two times less.\n\nWait, \"court pendant 3 heures\" on the first day, and \"court deux fois moins\" on the other days. So, maybe it's the distance that's two times less? That is, on the first day, he runs, say, D miles, and on the other days, he runs D/2 each. But wait, the total distance is 60 miles per week.\n\nWait, but the problem says he runs 60 miles each week, so maybe the total distance is 60 miles. So, if I let x be the distance he runs on the first day, then on the other two days, he runs x/2 each day. So, total distance is x + x/2 + x/2 = 2x. So, 2x = 60 miles, which means x = 30 miles. So, he runs 30 miles on the first day and 15 miles on each of the other two days.\n\nBut then, on the first day, he runs 30 miles in 3 hours, so his speed would be 30 miles / 3 hours = 10 mph. On the other days, he runs 15 miles in 1.5 hours, so 15 / 1.5 is also 10 mph. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but in this case, the time on the other days is 1.5 hours each, which matches the initial interpretation. So, whether you look at it as distance or time, the speed comes out to 10 mph. So, maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I thought \"court deux fois moins\" meant he runs at half the speed on the other days, that would complicate things, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says he runs two times less, which I think refers to the quantity, either distance or time. Since he runs for 3 hours on the first day, and half that time on the other days, leading to the same speed.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 10 mph is the right answer. Let me just recap:\n\n- Day 1: 3 hours, distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles\n- Day 2: 1.5 hours, distance = 10 mph * 1.5 hours = 15 miles\n- Day 3: 1.5 hours, distance = 15 miles\n- Total distance: 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 miles\n- Total time: 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours\n- Speed: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 mph\n\nSo, everything checks out.

So, he runs 30 miles on the first day and 15 miles on each of the other two days.\n\nBut then, on the first day, he runs 30 miles in 3 hours, so his speed would be 30 miles / 3 hours = 10 mph.

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that Dana runs four times faster than she walks. Hmm, so if I let her walking speed be something, say, \\( v \\) miles per hour, then her running speed would be \\( 4v \\). That makes sense. Four times faster means multiplying by 4.\n\nNext, it says she jumps two times less fast than she runs. Wait, that wording is a bit tricky. Does that mean she jumps at half the speed she runs? Because if she runs at \\( 4v \\), then jumping two times less fast would be \\( 4v / 2 = 2v \\). Yeah, that sounds right. So her jumping speed is \\( 2v \\).\n\nBut the problem also tells me that she jumps at a speed of 3 miles per hour. So if her jumping speed is \\( 2v \\), and that's equal to 3 mph, then I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 2v = 3 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( v \\), which is her walking speed, I divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\\[ v = 1.5 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nSo Dana walks at 1.5 mph. Then, her running speed is four times that, which is:\n\n\\[ 4v = 4 \\times 1.5 = 6 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nAlright, so she runs at 6 mph, walks at 1.5 mph, and jumps at 3 mph.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many miles she covers in six hours, given that she spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking. Wait, but the problem mentioned jumping earlier, but in the time breakdown, it's only talking about running and walking. Hmm, does she spend any time jumping? Or is the jumping part just extra information?\n\nLet me read the problem again. It says she passes 1/3 du temps à courir et 2/3 à marcher. So \"passes 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 walking.\" So it seems like she doesn't spend any time jumping. The jumping speed was just given for context, but since she only runs and walks during the six hours, I don't need to consider jumping in the calculation.\n\nWait, actually, the French word \"saute\" is used earlier, so maybe it's a mistranslation or misinterpretation. Let me check the original problem again:\n\n\"Dana court quatre fois plus vite qu'elle ne marche, mais saute deux fois moins vite qu'elle ne court. Si elle saute à une vitesse de 3 miles par heure, combien de miles parcourt-elle en six heures, sachant qu'elle passe 1/3 du temps à courir et 2/3 à marcher ?\"\n\nSo, the problem is in French. Let me parse it again.\n\n- \"Dana court quatre fois plus vite qu'elle ne marche\": Dana runs four times as fast as she walks.\n- \"mais saute deux fois moins vite qu'elle ne court\": but jumps two times less fast than she runs.\n- \"Si elle saute à une vitesse de 3 miles par heure\": if she jumps at a speed of 3 mph.\n- \"combien de miles parcourt-elle en six heures\": how many miles does she cover in six hours.\n- \"sachant qu'elle passe 1/3 du temps à courir et 2/3 à marcher\": knowing that she spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 walking.\n\nSo, in the last part, it's specifying the time she spends running and walking. It doesn't mention jumping in that time division. So, perhaps she only runs and walks during those six hours, and the jumping speed was just given as additional information to determine her walking and running speeds.\n\nSo, in that case, I can ignore the jumping part for the final calculation, except that it was necessary to find her walking and running speeds.\n\nWait, but if she is only running and walking, then the total time is six hours, with 1/3 running and 2/3 walking. So, let me compute the time spent running and walking.\n\nTotal time: 6 hours.\n\nTime running: (1/3) * 6 = 2 hours.\n\nTime walking: (2/3) * 6 = 4 hours.\n\nOkay, so she runs for 2 hours and walks for 4 hours.\n\nNow, her running speed is 6 mph, so the distance she covers running is:\n\nDistance = speed * time = 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles.\n\nHer walking speed is 1.5 mph, so the distance she covers walking is:\n\nDistance = 1.5 mph * 4 hours = 6 miles.\n\nSo, total distance is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me just check my steps again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n1. Defined walking speed as \\( v \\).\n2. Running speed is \\( 4v \\).\n3. Jumping speed is half the running speed, so \\( 2v \\).\n4. Given jumping speed is 3 mph, so \\( 2v = 3 \\) → \\( v = 1.5 \\) mph.\n5. So, walking speed is 1.5 mph, running is 6 mph.\n6. Time running: 2 hours, distance: 12 miles.\n7. Time walking: 4 hours, distance: 6 miles.\n8. Total distance: 18 miles.\n\nEverything seems to check out. I think 18 miles is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's see if the problem mentions anything else. The problem mentions she jumps two times less fast than she runs, which we used to find her walking speed. But since the time she spends jumping isn't mentioned, and the time breakdown is only for running and walking, it's safe to ignore jumping in the total distance.\n\nSo, yeah, 18 miles in six hours.

So, we're given information about the ages of three iPhones: Brandon's, Ben's, and Suzie's. The question is asking how old Brandon's iPhone is.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information provided:\n\n1. Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's. So, if I let B represent the age of Ben's iPhone, then Brandon's iPhone age would be 4 times B. I can write that as Brandon = 4 * Ben.\n\n2. Next, Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzie's. So, if S represents the age of Suzie's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone age is 2 times S. That would be Ben = 2 * Suzie.\n\n3. We're told that Suzie's iPhone is 1 year old. So, S = 1.\n\nNow, let me plug these values into the equations step by step.\n\nFirst, since Suzie's iPhone is 1 year old, we can find Ben's iPhone age. Using the second point:\n\nBen = 2 * Suzie's age\nBen = 2 * 1\nBen = 2 years.\n\nSo, Ben's iPhone is 2 years old. Now, moving on to Brandon's iPhone. Using the first point:\n\nBrandon = 4 * Ben's age\nBrandon = 4 * 2\nBrandon = 8 years.\n\nTherefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Suzie's iPhone being 1 year old, Ben's is twice that, which is indeed 2 years. Then, Brandon's is four times Ben's, so 4 times 2 is 8. Yep, that seems right.\n\nJust to visualize it, maybe I can represent this with some simple equations:\n\nLet S = Suzie's iPhone age = 1 year.\n\nThen, Ben's iPhone age B = 2 * S = 2 * 1 = 2 years.\n\nBrandon's iPhone age Br = 4 * B = 4 * 2 = 8 years.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nSuzie: 1 year\nBen: 2 * 1 = 2 years\nBrandon: 4 * 2 = 8 years\n\nYep, that looks consistent. I don't think I missed anything here. Each step logically follows from the previous one, so the calculations should be accurate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is in terms of ratios. If Suzie's iPhone is 1, Ben's is 2, which is 2 times Suzie's. Then Brandon's is 4 times Ben's, which is 4 * 2 = 8. So, in terms of ratios, Suzie : Ben : Brandon is 1 : 2 : 8. That scaling makes sense.\n\nI guess I could also represent this with a diagram or a table to make it even clearer, but since it's a straightforward multiplication problem, the equations seem sufficient.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Start with Suzie's age: 1 year.\n2. Ben's is double that: 2 years.\n3. Brandon's is quadruple Ben's: 8 years.\n\nNo steps skipped, each operation is multiplication by the given factor. So, 1 * 2 = 2, then 2 * 4 = 8. Simple and straightforward.\n\nI don't see any alternative interpretations of the problem that would change the result. The wording is pretty direct: \"quatre fois plus vieux\" and \"deux fois plus vieux.\" In French, that directly translates to \"four times older\" and \"two times older,\" so the multiplicative relationships are clear.\n\nSometimes, language can be tricky with age comparisons, like \"older than\" versus \"times older,\" but in this case, it's pretty unambiguous. So, I think 8 years is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't mix up any names, let me verify:\n\n- Suzie's iPhone is 1 year.\n- Ben's is two times that, so 2 years.\n- Brandon's is four times Ben's, which is 8 years.\n\nYep, that's consistent throughout.

{"idx": 41, "question": "Perg, le grand dragon, était assis au sommet du mont Farbo et crachait du feu sur une distance de 1 000 pieds. Polly pouvait lancer le javelot d'or, la seule arme capable de transpercer le dragon, mais sur une distance de 400 pieds, largement à portée de ses flammes. Toutefois, lorsque Polly tenait la pierre de saphir, elle pouvait le lancer trois fois plus loin. En tenant la pierre précieuse, à quelle distance Polly pouvait-elle se maintenir hors de portée des flammes, tout en parvenant à frapper le dragon avec le javelot d'or ?", "answer": "200", "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem about Polly and the dragon Perg. Let me try to understand the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, Perg, the big dragon, is sitting on top of Mount Farbo and can breathe fire up to 1,000 feet. That means anything within 1,000 feet is in danger of getting burned by his flames. So, Polly needs to stay outside this 1,000-foot range to be safe.\n\nBut Polly has a javelin called the golden javelin, which is the only weapon that can pierce the dragon. However, this javelin can only be thrown 400 feet. That's a problem because 400 feet is way within the 1,000-foot fire range. So, Polly can't just stand there and throw it because the dragon would burn her before she can even throw it.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. If Polly holds the sapphire stone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Hmm, okay, so normally it's 400 feet, but with the sapphire, it's 3 times that distance. Let me calculate that first.\n\n3 times 400 feet is 1,200 feet. So, with the sapphire, Polly can throw the javelin 1,200 feet. That's further than the dragon's fire range of 1,000 feet. So, that means if Polly can throw the javelin 1,200 feet, she can potentially hit the dragon from beyond his fire range.\n\nBut hold on, the question is asking at what distance Polly can maintain herself so that she's out of the dragon's fire range but still able to hit him with the javelin. So, she needs to be just far enough that the dragon can't burn her, but close enough (or far enough?) to throw the javelin and hit him.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The dragon's fire range is 1,000 feet. So, Polly needs to be more than 1,000 feet away to be safe. But with the sapphire, her javelin range is 1,200 feet. So, in order for her to hit the dragon, she needs to be within 1,200 feet of him. But she also needs to be more than 1,000 feet away to avoid the flames.\n\nSo, the distance Polly can maintain is somewhere between 1,000 feet and 1,200 feet. But the question is asking for the exact distance where she can stay out of the fire range but still reach the dragon with the javelin.\n\nWait, but if she is exactly at 1,000 feet, she is still within the fire range, so that's dangerous. If she is exactly at 1,200 feet, she can just reach the dragon with the javelin but is she safe? Wait, 1,200 feet is beyond the dragon's fire range of 1,000 feet, so she would be safe. But can she hit the dragon from 1,200 feet? Yes, because her javelin range with the sapphire is 1,200 feet.\n\nBut maybe the question is asking for the minimal distance where she's just out of the fire range but can still hit the dragon. So, the minimal safe distance would be just over 1,000 feet, but since we can't have fractions of a foot in this context, maybe it's 1,001 feet? But then again, the javelin can reach up to 1,200 feet, so she can actually be as far as 1,200 feet away and still hit the dragon.\n\nBut wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, \"à quelle distance Polly pouvait-elle se maintenir hors de portée des flammes, tout en parvenant à frapper le dragon avec le javelot d'or ?\" which translates to \"At what distance could Polly maintain herself out of the range of the flames, while still managing to hit the dragon with the golden javelin?\"\n\nSo, perhaps it's asking for the maximum distance at which she can still hit the dragon while being out of the fire range. Since the javelin can go up to 1,200 feet, and the fire range is 1,000 feet, the maximum distance she can be is 1,200 feet. But wait, 1,200 feet is beyond the fire range, so that's safe.\n\nBut actually, wait, if she is at 1,200 feet, the dragon is 1,200 feet away from her. But the dragon can only breathe fire up to 1,000 feet. So, she is beyond the fire range, so she's safe. But she can throw the javelin 1,200 feet, so she can hit the dragon from that distance.\n\nAlternatively, if she is closer, say 1,001 feet, she can still hit the dragon because her javelin can reach 1,200 feet, but she would be just barely out of the fire range. But the question is asking for the distance she can maintain herself. So, perhaps it's the minimal distance where she is out of the fire range but can still hit the dragon. But in that case, it would be just over 1,000 feet, but since 1,000 feet is the exact limit, she needs to be more than that.\n\nBut in terms of exact numbers, 1,000 feet is the fire range, so to be out of range, she must be more than 1,000 feet away. Her javelin can reach 1,200 feet, so she can be anywhere beyond 1,000 feet up to 1,200 feet away and still hit the dragon. But the question is asking for the distance she can maintain herself. It might be the maximum distance she can be and still hit the dragon, which would be 1,200 feet.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If she is 1,200 feet away, she can hit the dragon, and she's safe because the dragon can't reach her with fire. So, that's the maximum distance she can be. But does she need to be exactly at 1,200 feet, or can she be anywhere beyond 1,000 feet?\n\nHmm, the way the question is phrased is \"à quelle distance Polly pouvait-elle se maintenir hors de portée des flammes, tout en parvenant à frapper le dragon avec le javelot d'or ?\" So, \"at what distance could she maintain herself out of the flames' range, while still hitting the dragon...\" So, it's asking for the distance she needs to be at to both be safe and be able to hit the dragon. So, the maximum distance is 1,200 feet, but she can also be closer as long as she's beyond 1,000 feet.\n\nBut maybe the question is more about the minimal distance she can be to be just out of the flames but still within the javelin range. Wait, no, because the javelin range is longer than the flames. So, the minimal safe distance is just beyond 1,000 feet, but she can be as far as 1,200 feet.\n\nBut perhaps, the question is looking for the distance where she can be exactly at the point where she is just out of the flames but can still hit the dragon. So, that would be 1,000 feet plus some epsilon, but in terms of exact numbers, maybe it's 1,000 feet. But 1,000 feet is the limit of the dragon's fire, so being exactly at 1,000 feet would mean she's still in danger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that Polly can be at a distance where her javelin can reach the dragon, and she's just beyond the flames. So, the overlapping point where both conditions are satisfied is from 1,000 feet to 1,200 feet. But the question is asking for the specific distance.\n\nWait, maybe I need to calculate it differently. Let's see.\n\nThe dragon's fire range is 1,000 feet. Polly's javelin range with the sapphire is 1,200 feet. So, the overlap where she can hit the dragon and be safe is from 1,000 feet to 1,200 feet. But the question is asking for the distance she can maintain herself, so maybe it's the minimal distance beyond the fire range where she can still hit the dragon.\n\nWait, but if she is just beyond 1,000 feet, say 1,001 feet, she can still hit the dragon with the javelin because 1,001 is less than 1,200. So, the minimal distance she needs to be is just beyond 1,000 feet, but the maximum distance is 1,200 feet.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"à quelle distance Polly pouvait-elle se maintenir...\" which is singular, so maybe it's referring to the maximum distance where she can both be safe and hit the dragon, which would be 1,200 feet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the minimal distance beyond the fire range, but since distances are continuous, it's not an exact number, but perhaps the question is expecting 1,200 feet as the answer.\n\nWait, let me think again. If Polly is holding the sapphire, her javelin range is 1,200 feet. The dragon's fire range is 1,000 feet. So, to be out of the fire range, Polly needs to be more than 1,000 feet away. But she can throw the javelin up to 1,200 feet. So, the maximum distance she can be from the dragon and still hit him is 1,200 feet. At that point, she is 1,200 feet away, which is beyond the dragon's 1,000-foot fire range, so she is safe, and she can throw the javelin exactly 1,200 feet to hit him.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1,200 feet.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure. Let me rephrase the problem.\n\nPerg can breathe fire up to 1,000 feet. Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet normally, but with the sapphire, it's three times farther, so 1,200 feet. So, with the sapphire, her javelin can reach 1,200 feet. So, if she is 1,200 feet away, she can hit the dragon, and she is safe because the dragon can't reach her with fire beyond 1,000 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if she is closer, like 1,100 feet, she can still hit the dragon because 1,100 is less than 1,200, and she is safe because 1,100 is more than 1,000. So, the distance she can maintain is anywhere beyond 1,000 feet up to 1,200 feet. But the question is asking \"à quelle distance\" which is singular, so maybe it's expecting the maximum distance, which is 1,200 feet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the minimal distance where she can be just out of the fire range and still hit the dragon, which would be just over 1,000 feet, but since we can't have fractions, maybe 1,001 feet, but that's not a standard answer. The problem probably expects 1,200 feet as the answer because that's the maximum distance she can be and still hit the dragon, while being safe.\n\nYes, I think that's the case. So, the answer is 1,200 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\nPolly pouvait se maintenir à une distance de \\boxed{1200} pieds.\n</think>\n\nPerg, the dragon, can breathe fire up to 1,000 feet. Polly can throw the golden javelin 400 feet normally, but with the sapphire stone, she can throw it three times farther, which is 1,200 feet. \n\nTo be safe from the dragon's fire, Polly needs to stay beyond 1,000 feet. However, she must also be able to hit the dragon with the javelin. Since the javelin can reach 1,200 feet, Polly can maintain a distance of 1,200 feet, which is beyond the dragon's fire range and still allows her to hit him.\n\nThus, the distance Polly can maintain herself is \\boxed{1200} feet.", "thinking_pred": "Okay, so I have this problem about Polly and the dragon Perg. Let me try to understand the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, Perg, the big dragon, is sitting on top of Mount Farbo and can breathe fire up to 1,000 feet. That means anything within 1,000 feet is in danger of getting burned by his flames. So, Polly needs to stay outside this 1,000-foot range to be safe.\n\nBut Polly has a javelin called the golden javelin, which is the only weapon that can pierce the dragon. However, this javelin can only be thrown 400 feet. That's a problem because 400 feet is way within the 1,000-foot fire range. So, Polly can't just stand there and throw it because the dragon would burn her before she can even throw it.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. If Polly holds the sapphire stone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Hmm, okay, so normally it's 400 feet, but with the sapphire, it's 3 times that distance. Let me calculate that first.\n\n3 times 400 feet is 1,200 feet. So, with the sapphire, Polly can throw the javelin 1,200 feet. That's further than the dragon's fire range of 1,000 feet. So, that means if Polly can throw the javelin 1,200 feet, she can potentially hit the dragon from beyond his fire range.\n\nBut hold on, the question is asking at what distance Polly can maintain herself so that she's out of the dragon's fire range but still able to hit him with the javelin. So, she needs to be just far enough that the dragon can't burn her, but close enough (or far enough?) to throw the javelin and hit him.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The dragon's fire range is 1,000 feet. So, Polly needs to be more than 1,000 feet away to be safe. But with the sapphire, her javelin range is 1,200 feet. So, in order for her to hit the dragon, she needs to be within 1,200 feet of him. But she also needs to be more than 1,000 feet away to avoid the flames.\n\nSo, the distance Polly can maintain is somewhere between 1,000 feet and 1,200 feet. But the question is asking for the exact distance where she can stay out of the fire range but still reach the dragon with the javelin.\n\nWait, but if she is exactly at 1,000 feet, she is still within the fire range, so that's dangerous. If she is exactly at 1,200 feet, she can just reach the dragon with the javelin but is she safe? Wait, 1,200 feet is beyond the dragon's fire range of 1,000 feet, so she would be safe. But can she hit the dragon from 1,200 feet? Yes, because her javelin range with the sapphire is 1,200 feet.\n\nBut maybe the question is asking for the minimal distance where she's just out of the fire range but can still hit the dragon. So, the minimal safe distance would be just over 1,000 feet, but since we can't have fractions of a foot in this context, maybe it's 1,001 feet?

Since the javelin can go up to 1,200 feet, and the fire range is 1,000 feet, the maximum distance she can be is 1,200 feet.

At the end of the evening, after all the guests had taken and eaten their pies, there were 14 slices left. The question is, how many slices did the guests take in total?\n\nHmm, alright, let's break this down step by step. First, she made 5 tartes, each cut into 8 parts. So, to find out how many slices there were in total, I need to multiply the number of tartes by the number of slices per tarte. That would be 5 times 8.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 5 multiplied by 8 is 40. So, there were 40 slices in total at the beginning.\n\nNow, at the end of the evening, there were 14 slices left. That means the guests ate some of the slices, and 14 remained. So, to find out how many slices the guests took, I need to subtract the number of slices left from the total number of slices.\n\nSo, that would be 40 minus 14. Let me compute that. 40 minus 10 is 30, and then minus 4 more is 26. So, 40 minus 14 equals 26.\n\nTherefore, the guests took 26 slices in total.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. If there were 40 slices and 14 are left, that means 26 were taken and eaten, right? Yeah, that makes sense because 26 plus 14 is 40, which was the original number of slices.

Each pound of beeswax allows him to make 10 taper candles. The cost for one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. He produces and sells 20 candles, and each candle is sold for $2.00. The question is asking for his net profit. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much it costs Charlie to produce 20 candles. Since one pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, to make 20 candles, he would need two pounds of beeswax, right? Because 20 divided by 10 is 2. So, two pounds of beeswax and wicks would cost him 2 times $10, which is $20.00. Okay, so his total cost is $20.00.\n\nNext, I need to calculate his revenue from selling these 20 candles. Each candle is sold for $2.00, so 20 candles would bring in 20 times $2, which is $40.00. So, he makes $40 from sales.\n\nNow, to find the net profit, I subtract the total cost from the total revenue. That would be $40 minus $20, which equals $20. So, Charlie's net profit is $20.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 20 candles divided by 10 candles per pound is 2 pounds. 2 pounds at $10 per pound is indeed $20. Then, 20 candles times $2 each is $40. $40 minus $20 is $20. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think I got it. So, his net profit is $20.00. That makes sense because he's selling each candle for double the cost per candle, but considering the bulk purchase, it still works out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the cost per candle. If one pound makes 10 candles and costs $10, then each candle costs $1.00 in beeswax. So, each candle is sold for $2.00, which means he makes a $1.00 profit per candle. Therefore, 20 candles would give him 20 times $1, which is $20. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo, either way I calculate it, whether by total cost and revenue or by per-unit profit, it comes out to $20.

Un article de blog demande 4 heures de travail en moyenne, ce qui inclut les recherches et la rédaction. La semaine passée, elle a rédigé 5 articles le lundi et 2/5 de fois plus d'articles le mardi. Le mercredi, elle a écrit deux fois plus d'articles qu'elle n'en a écrit le mardi. Calculez le nombre total d'heures passées à rédiger des articles durant ces trois jours.", "answer": "104", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to figure out how many hours Mérédith spent writing blog articles over these three days. So, she works as a freelance blogger, writing about health topics, and each article takes her about 4 hours on average, including research and writing. \n\nFirst, let's break down the information given day by day.\n\nOn Monday, she wrote 5 articles. That seems straightforward. So, if each article takes 4 hours, then the time she spent on Monday would be 5 articles multiplied by 4 hours per article. Let me calculate that: 5 * 4 = 20 hours. Okay, so she spent 20 hours on Monday.\n\nNext, on Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out how many articles that is. She wrote 5 articles on Monday, so 2/5 more would be calculated as 5 plus (2/5 of 5). Wait, is that the right way to interpret it? Or is it 2/5 times the number of articles she wrote on Monday? Let me see.\n\nThe problem says: \"elle a rédigé 5 articles le lundi et 2/5 de fois plus d'articles le mardi.\" So, \"2/5 de fois plus\" – that translates to 2/5 times more. So, does that mean 5 + (2/5 * 5) or does it mean 5 * (2/5)? Hmm, I think it's 2/5 times the number she wrote on Monday, which would be 5 multiplied by 2/5. Let me check: 2/5 times more could be interpreted as 2/5 * 5, which is 2. So, on Tuesday, she wrote 2 articles.\n\nWait, but sometimes \"times more\" can be confusing. For example, \"2 times more\" usually means 2 * original amount, but in this case, it's 2/5 times more. So, 2/5 times more than 5 would be 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7. But that conflicts with the usual interpretation where \"times more\" means multiplication. Wait, I need to be careful.\n\nIn French, \"2/5 de fois plus\" might mean multiplying by 2/5. Let me think. If it's \"de fois plus,\" it's similar to \"times as much.\" So, \"2/5 de fois plus\" would mean 2/5 times the original amount, right? So, 5 articles on Monday, 2/5 times 5 is 2. So, 2 articles on Tuesday. That seems more consistent with the phrasing. So, 2 articles on Tuesday.\n\nLet me verify that interpretation. If I say \"2/5 de fois plus\" in French, it's like saying 2/5 times as much, so it's 2/5 multiplied by the original number. So, 5 * (2/5) = 2. Okay, that makes sense. So, Tuesday she wrote 2 articles.\n\nNow, moving on to Wednesday. She wrote two times more articles than she did on Tuesday. So, two times more than Tuesday. So, 2 times the number she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 2 articles on Tuesday, so two times that would be 4 articles on Wednesday.\n\nWait, hold on. In French, \"deux fois plus\" usually means two times more, which is three times as much, right? Because \"deux fois plus\" is like adding two times the original amount. For example, if I have 1 apple and someone has two times more, they have 3 apples. But in some contexts, it might mean two times as much, which would be 2 apples. Hmm, I need to be careful here.\n\nThe problem says: \"elle a écrit deux fois plus d'articles qu'elle n'en a écrit le mardi.\" So, \"two times more articles than she wrote on Tuesday.\" So, in French, \"deux fois plus\" can mean two times as much, not two times more. Wait, no, actually, in French, \"deux fois plus que\" generally means two times as much, not two times more. So, if she wrote 2 articles on Tuesday, then two times as much would be 4 articles on Wednesday. Alternatively, if it were \"deux fois plus que,\" it could be ambiguous, but in this case, it's \"deux fois plus d'articles qu'elle n'en a écrit le mardi,\" which is two times more articles than she wrote on Tuesday. So, in that case, \"two times more\" would be 2 * 2 = 4. So, Wednesday she wrote 4 articles.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have 2 apples and someone has two times more, do they have 2 * 2 = 4 or 2 + 2 = 4? So, actually, 4 is the same in both cases. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Maybe in French, \"deux fois plus\" does mean two times as much, so 2 * 2 = 4. So, in that case, Wednesday is 4 articles. Alternatively, if it were \"deux fois plus que,\" it could be two times the difference, but I think in this context, it's two times as much. So, 4 articles on Wednesday.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Monday: 5 articles\n- Tuesday: 2 articles\n- Wednesday: 4 articles\n\nNow, each article takes 4 hours. So, the total hours would be the sum of the hours spent each day.\n\nLet me calculate each day's hours:\n\n- Monday: 5 articles * 4 hours/article = 20 hours\n- Tuesday: 2 articles * 4 hours/article = 8 hours\n- Wednesday: 4 articles * 4 hours/article = 16 hours\n\nAdding them up: 20 + 8 + 16 = 44 hours.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations:\n\n5 * 4 = 20 (Monday)\n2 * 4 = 8 (Tuesday)\n4 * 4 = 16 (Wednesday)\n20 + 8 = 28; 28 + 16 = 44.\n\nYes, that adds up to 44 hours.\n\nBut just to make sure I interpreted the number of articles correctly.\n\nOn Monday, she wrote 5 articles.\n\nOn Tuesday, it's 2/5 times more than Monday. If \"times more\" is interpreted as multiplying the original number, then 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles on Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, she wrote two times more than Tuesday. If \"times more\" is two times the number on Tuesday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 articles.\n\nAlternatively, if \"two times more\" is interpreted as adding two times the original, but in this case, since it's \"two times more than Tuesday,\" it's 2 + (2*2) = 6? Wait, that might not be right.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe in French, \"deux fois plus\" means two times as much, which is 2 * 2 = 4, not 2 + 2 = 4. Wait, actually, 2 + 2 is also 4, so in this case, the result is the same whether you interpret it as two times as much or two times more.\n\nWait, maybe I confused myself earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nIn English, \"two times more\" can sometimes be ambiguous, but in French, \"deux fois plus\" is generally understood as two times as much, so 2 * 2 = 4. So, 4 articles on Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, the total is 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 articles over three days.\n\nWait, 11 articles? Wait, 5 + 2 + 4 is 11? Wait, 5 + 2 is 7, plus 4 is 11? Wait, 5 + 2 is 7, 7 + 4 is 11. Wait, but 11 articles? Each taking 4 hours, so total hours would be 11 * 4 = 44 hours. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again:\n\nMonday: 5\n\nTuesday: 2/5 of Monday's 5 is 2, so 2 articles.\n\nWednesday: two times Tuesday's 2 is 4.\n\nSo, 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 articles.\n\n11 * 4 hours = 44 hours.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I might have confused myself earlier with the \"times more\" phrasing, but breaking it down step by step makes it clearer.\n\nSo, the total number of hours Mérédith spent writing articles over these three days is 44 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of hours Mérédith spent writing articles during these three days is \\boxed{44}.\n</think>\n\nMérédith est une blogueuse freelance qui rédige des articles sur les thèmes de la santé.

{"idx": 46, "question": "Avant d'aller travailler au café, Candice a mis 80 pense-bêtes dans son sac à main. En chemin, elle s'est arrêtée pour acheter un paquet de pense-bêtes au magasin. Arrivée au travail, elle a placé un pense-bête sur chacune des 220 tasses de café. Si par la suite il ne lui restait plus que 23 pense-bêtes, combien y avait-il de pense-bêtes dans le paquet qu'elle a acheté ?", "answer": "163", "raw_response": "Okay, so Candice went to work at the café, and before that, she put 80 sticky notes in her handbag. Then, on her way, she stopped by a store and bought a pack of sticky notes. When she got to work, she placed one sticky note on each of the 220 coffee cups. After that, she only had 23 sticky notes left. The question is, how many sticky notes were in the pack she bought?\n\nHmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, Candice started with 80 sticky notes. Then, she bought another pack. Let me call the number of sticky notes in that pack \"x\". So, before she started using them, her total number of sticky notes was 80 plus x.\n\nNow, she used some of these sticky notes at work. Specifically, she placed one on each of the 220 coffee cups. That means she used 220 sticky notes. So, her total usage was 220.\n\nAfter using them, she was left with 23 sticky notes. So, the total number of sticky notes she had before using them minus the ones she used equals the ones she has left. So, mathematically, that would be:\n\n80 + x - 220 = 23\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n80 + x - 220 = 23\n\nOkay, now I can solve for x. Let me simplify the equation step by step.\n\nFirst, combine the constants on the left side. 80 minus 220 is... let's see, 220 minus 80 is 140, so 80 - 220 is -140. So, the equation becomes:\n\nx - 140 = 23\n\nNow, to find x, I need to isolate it.

After that, she only had 23 sticky notes left. The question is, how many sticky notes were in the pack she bought?\n\nHmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, Candice started with 80 sticky notes. Then, she bought another pack. Let me call the number of sticky notes in that pack \"x\". So, before she started using them, her total number of sticky notes was 80 plus x.\n\nNow, she used some of these sticky notes at work. Specifically, she placed one on each of the 220 coffee cups.

Hmm, wait. Let me write that down:\n\nTotal spent on blue ties: $200\nCost per blue tie: $40\n\nSo, how many blue ties did he buy? That should be total spent divided by cost per tie.

The question is asking how many pieces she got. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure all the measurements are in the same unit. The wire is 4 feet long, and each piece is 6 inches. I know that 1 foot is 12 inches, so maybe I can convert feet to inches to make the calculation easier.\n\nSo, 4 feet multiplied by 12 inches per foot. Let me calculate that: 4 times 12 is 48. So the wire is 48 inches long. Got it.\n\nEach piece is 6 inches long. To find out how many 6-inch pieces she can get from 48 inches, I need to divide the total length by the length of each piece. That should give me the number of pieces.\n\nSo, 48 inches divided by 6 inches per piece. Let me do that division: 48 divided by 6 is 8. So, she should have 8 pieces.

Yep, that matches the total length of the wire. So, that checks out.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. No, wait, does cutting the wire into pieces always result in the exact number without any leftover? Since 48 is perfectly divisible by 6, yes, there won't be any leftover wire. So, Tracy gets exactly 8 pieces, each 6 inches long.\n\nJust to recap, conversion of feet to inches was the key here because the units were different. Once both were in inches, simple division gave the answer. It's important to make sure all units are consistent before performing calculations to avoid errors.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is how many 6-inch pieces fit into 4 feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 6 inches is half a foot. So, each piece is half a foot. Therefore, in 4 feet, how many half-foot pieces can you get? That would be 4 divided by 0.5, which is 8.

So, Richard lives in one of the apartments in a 15-story building. Each floor has 8 apartments. Three-fourths of the building is occupied. I need to find the total number of unoccupied apartments in the building.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given. The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 apartments. So, to find the total number of apartments in the building, I can multiply the number of floors by the number of apartments per floor. That should give me the total capacity of the building.\n\nSo, total apartments = number of floors × apartments per floor. Plugging in the numbers, that's 15 × 8. Let me calculate that. 15 times 8 is 120. So, the building has a total of 120 apartments.\n\nNow, it's given that three-fourths of the building is occupied. That means three-fourths of these 120 apartments are occupied, and the rest are unoccupied. I need to find the number of unoccupied apartments.\n\nFirst, let me find out how many apartments are occupied. If three-fourths are occupied, then the number of occupied apartments is (3/4) × total apartments. So, that's (3/4) × 120. Let me compute that. 3 divided by 4 is 0.75, and 0.75 multiplied by 120 is... let's see, 120 times 0.75. 120 times 0.7 is 84, and 120 times 0.05 is 6, so adding those together, 84 + 6 is 90. So, 90 apartments are occupied.\n\nBut the question is asking for the number of inoccupied apartments. So, if there are 120 total and 90 are occupied, the unoccupied ones would be the difference. So, total unoccupied = total apartments - occupied apartments. That's 120 - 90. That equals 30.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If three-fourths are occupied, then one-fourth must be unoccupied, right? Because 1 - 3/4 is 1/4.

He gets 252 eggs each day, right? So if I multiply that by the number of days in a week, which is 7, that should give me the total number of eggs per week. Let me write that down: 252 eggs/day * 7 days. Hmm, let me do that multiplication.\n\n252 times 7. Let me calculate that. 252 * 7. 200*7 is 1400, 50*7 is 350, and 2*7 is 14.

A dozen is 12 eggs, so I can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens he has.\n\nSo, 1764 eggs divided by 12 eggs per dozen. Let me compute that. 1764 ÷ 12. Let's see, 12 goes into 17 once, with a remainder of 5. Bring down the 6 to make 56. 12 goes into 56 four times, which is 48. Subtracting that from 56 gives me 8. Bring down the 4 to make 84. 12 goes into 84 exactly 7 times. So putting that all together, 12 into 1764 is 147. So, 1764 ÷ 12 equals 147 dozen.\n\nNow, each dozen sells for $2, so to find out how much he makes, I need to multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen. That would be 147 dozen * $2/dozen. Let me calculate that. 147 times 2 is 294. So, $294.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, 252 eggs per day, times 7 days gives 1764 eggs. Divided by 12 gives 147 dozen. Times 2 dollars is 294. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify each step again to be sure.\n\nFirst, 252 eggs per day. Multiply by 7: 252*7. 252*7, as I did before, is 1764. Correct. Then, 1764 eggs divided by 12: 1764 ÷ 12 is 147. Yes, because 12*140 is 1680, and 12*7 is 84, so 1680+84 is 1764. So, 147 dozen. Then, 147*2 is 294. That's straightforward.\n\nSo, all the steps check out. Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week from selling his eggs.\n\nJust to think about it another way, maybe I can compute his daily earnings first and then multiply by 7. Let me try that approach.\n\nHe has 252 eggs per day. How many dozens is that? 252 ÷ 12. Let's see, 252 ÷ 12. 12*21 is 252, so 252 ÷ 12 is 21 dozen. So, he has 21 dozen per day. If he sells each dozen for $2, then his daily earnings are 21*$2, which is $42 per day.\n\nThen, to find out his weekly earnings, I multiply $42 by 7 days: 42*7. Let me calculate that. 40*7 is 280, and 2*7 is 14, so 280+14 is 294. So, $294 per week. Same result as before. So, that method works too.\n\nThis consistency makes me more confident that $294 is the correct answer. Both methods lead to the same result, which is a good sign.\n\nAnother way I can think about it is to consider unit conversions. Starting with eggs per day, convert to dozens per day, then to dollars per day, then to dollars per week.\n\n252 eggs/day * (1 dozen / 12 eggs) = 21 dozen/day.\n\n21 dozen/day * ($2 / dozen) = $42/day.\n\n$42/day * 7 days/week = $294/week.\n\nYep, same thing.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified them multiple ways, so I feel confident that the answer is $294 per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\nLloyd gagne \\boxed{294} dollars par semaine.\n</think>\n\nLloyd owns a chicken coop where his chickens lay 252 eggs per day.

I need to figure out how many toys he needs to remove to make sure the total weight reduction is 15 pounds.\n\nFirst, let me break this down. The total weight he needs to lose is 15 pounds. He's removing 30 comic books, and each of those is 1/4 pound. So, let me calculate the weight reduction from just the comic books. \n\nEach comic is 1/4 pound, so 30 comics would be 30 multiplied by 1/4. Let me do that:\n\n30 * (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds.\n\nOkay, so by removing 30 comic books, he's reducing the weight by 7.5 pounds. But he needs to reduce the total weight by 15 pounds. That means he still needs to remove an additional 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.\n\nNow, this remaining 7.5 pounds has to come from removing toys. Each toy is 1/2 a pound. So, how many toys does he need to remove to lose 7.5 pounds?\n\nLet me set up an equation. Let x be the number of toys he needs to remove. Each toy is 1/2 pound, so the total weight from the toys is (1/2)*x. This should equal 7.5 pounds.\n\nSo, (1/2)*x = 7.5\n\nTo solve for x, I can multiply both sides by 2:\n\nx = 7.5 * 2\nx = 15\n\nSo, he needs to remove 15 toys.

I need to figure out which day the mechanic made more money and then find the difference between those two days. Hmm, so he repairs truck tires and car tires, charging different rates for each. For each truck tire, he charges $60, and for each car tire, he charges $40. \n\nOn Thursday, he repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, he repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. So first, I should calculate how much he made each day.\n\nStarting with Thursday. For the truck tires, he did 6 of them. Each one is $60, so that would be 6 multiplied by 60. Let me do that: 6 times 60 is 360. So he made $360 from truck tire repairs on Thursday. Then, he also repaired 4 car tires. Each car tire is $40, so that's 4 times 40. 4 times 40 is 160. So from car tires on Thursday, he made $160. \n\nTo find the total for Thursday, I should add those two amounts together. 360 plus 160 is 520. So, Thursday's total is $520.\n\nNow, let's move on to Friday. On Friday, he didn't repair any truck tires, so that part is $0. But he did repair 12 car tires. Each car tire is $40, so that's 12 times 40. Let me calculate that: 12 times 40. Hmm, 10 times 40 is 400, and 2 times 40 is 80, so 400 plus 80 is 480.

Therefore, Thursday was the day with higher revenue.\n\nThe question is asking how much more money he made on the day with higher revenue. So, I subtract the smaller amount from the larger one. That would be $520 minus $480. Let me do that subtraction: 520 minus 480 is 40. So, he made $40 more on Thursday.\n\nI think that should be the answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFor Thursday:\n6 truck tires at $60 each: 6*60=360\n4 car tires at $40 each: 4*40=160\nTotal: 360+160=520. That seems right.\n\nFor Friday:\n12 car tires at $40 each: 12*40=480\nTotal: 480. That also looks correct.\n\nDifference: 520 - 480 = 40.

Therefore, Thursday was the day with higher revenue.\n\nThe question is asking how much more money he made on the day with higher revenue. So, I subtract the smaller amount from the larger one. That would be $520 minus $480. Let me do that subtraction: 520 minus 480 is 40. So, he made $40 more on Thursday.\n\nI think that should be the answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFor Thursday:\n6 truck tires at $60 each: 6*60=360\n4 car tires at $40 each: 4*40=160\nTotal: 360+160=520. That seems right.\n\nFor Friday:\n12 car tires at $40 each: 12*40=480\nTotal: 480. That also looks correct.\n\nDifference: 520 - 480 = 40. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, the day with higher revenue was Thursday, and he made $40 more that day compared to Friday.\n\n**Final Answer**\nLe jour où les revenus étaient les plus élevés, le mécanicien a gagné \\boxed{40} $ en plus.", "answer_pred": "Le mécanicien répare des pneus de camions et de voitures avec des tarifs différents.

So, the Doubtfire sisters went to a local animal shelter and adopted 7 kittens. That's straightforward—7 kittens in their car. Now, on their way back, they get a call from their mom. Their mom tells them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens.\n\nHmm, so first, let's break down the information given. The sisters have two house cats: Patchy and Trixie. Patchy had three times the number of kittens that were adopted. They adopted 7 kittens, so that means Patchy had 3 times 7. Let me write that down: Patchy's kittens = 3 × 7. Let me compute that—3 multiplied by 7 is 21. So Patchy had 21 kittens.\n\nThen, Trixie had 12 kittens. That's straightforward. So Trixie has 12 kittens. Now, the question is asking how many kittens the Doubtfire family has now. So, we need to add up all the kittens they have.\n\nWait, so let's make sure we're counting all the right groups. The sisters adopted 7 kittens. Then, their own cats, Patchy and Trixie, had kittens as well. So, the total number of kittens is the adopted ones plus the ones from Patchy and Trixie.\n\nSo, first, the adopted kittens: 7. Then, Patchy's kittens: 21. Then, Trixie's kittens: 12. So, adding those together: 7 + 21 + 12.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. 7 plus 21 is 28, right? Because 20 plus 7 is 27, plus 1 more is 28. Then, 28 plus 12 is 40.

Hmm, so Pierre always buys a movie ticket and some popcorn. Each time he goes, he spends 7 dollars on the ticket and another 7 dollars on popcorn. So, every visit costs him 7 plus 7 dollars.\n\nLet me write that down. The cost per visit is 7 $ for the ticket plus 7 $ for popcorn. So, 7 + 7 equals 14 dollars per visit. Got that. So each time he goes, it's 14 bucks.\n\nNow, Pierre has 42 dollars for the whole week. He wants to know how many times he can go to the movies with that amount. So, I think I need to divide the total amount he has by the cost per visit. That should give me the number of times he can go.\n\nSo, total money is 42 dollars, and each visit costs 14 dollars. So, 42 divided by 14 equals... let's do that calculation. 14 times 3 is 42. So, 42 divided by 14 is 3. That means Pierre can go to the movies 3 times this week.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes, when I'm dividing, I might mix up the numbers. Let me break it down more carefully. So, each visit is 14 dollars. How many times does 14 go into 42?\n\nWell, 14 times 1 is 14, subtract that from 42, we have 28 left. 14 times 2 is 28, subtract that from 28, we have 0. So, that's 2 times. Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense because 14 times 3 is 42. Hmm, maybe I did that wrong.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I subtract 14 from 42, I get 28. Then, subtract another 14, I get 14. Subtract another 14, and I get 0. So that's three times. So, actually, 14 goes into 42 exactly 3 times. So, Pierre can go 3 times.\n\nLet me think of another way to check. If he goes once, he spends 14 dollars. If he goes twice, he spends 28 dollars. If he goes three times, he spends 42 dollars. So, with 42 dollars, he can go three times without any money left over.\n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted? Maybe if the 7 dollars for the ticket and 7 dollars for popcorn are separate, but no, it's 7 and 7 each time, so together it's 14 each time.\n\nAlternatively, if he had different amounts, but in this case, it's consistent. So, I think my calculation is correct. 42 divided by 14 is 3. So, Pierre can go to the cinema 3 times.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about if he goes 3 times: 3 tickets at 7 each is 21 dollars, and 3 popcorns at 7 each is another 21 dollars. 21 plus 21 is 42. Perfect, that adds up exactly to the amount he has.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's solid. There's no leftover money, so he can't go a fourth time because that would require 14 more dollars, which he doesn't have. So, 3 times is the maximum.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems straightforward: total money divided by cost per visit. No hidden fees or anything mentioned, so it's a simple division problem.\n\nAnother way to think about it is in terms of multiplication. If 14 times 3 is 42, then 42 divided by 14 is 3.

So, the additional weight that can be added without breaking the bridge's limit is the difference between these two numbers.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nTotal weight limit = 5,000 pounds\n\nWeight of truck + driver = 3,755 pounds\n\nSo, the extra weight the truck can carry is 5,000 - 3,755. Let me calculate that.\n\n5,000 minus 3,755. Hmm, 5,000 minus 3,000 is 2,000, and then minus 755 more would be 2,000 - 755. Wait, that's not right. Because 3,755 is 3,000 + 755, so subtracting that from 5,000 would be 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000, and then 2,000 - 755.\n\nWait, 2,000 - 755. Let me do that step by step. 755 is 700 + 55. So, 2,000 - 700 is 1,300, and then 1,300 - 55 is 1,245. So, the truck can carry an additional 1,245 pounds without exceeding the bridge's limit.\n\nNow, each box weighs 15 pounds. So, to find out how many boxes can be loaded, I need to divide the additional weight capacity by the weight of each box.\n\nSo, number of boxes = 1,245 / 15.\n\nLet me compute that. 15 goes into 1,245 how many times? Well, 15 times 80 is 1,200. Then, 1,245 - 1,200 is 45. 15 goes into 45 exactly 3 times. So, 80 + 3 is 83.\n\nTherefore, the truck can carry 83 boxes without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make an error. So, 3,755 plus 15 times 83 should be equal to 5,000.\n\nCalculating 15 times 83: 15*80=1,200; 15*3=45; so 1,200 + 45=1,245.\n\nThen, adding that to 3,755: 3,755 + 1,245.\n\n3,755 + 1,000 is 4,755.\n\n4,755 + 245 is 5,000. Perfect, that adds up exactly.\n\nSo, the maximum number of boxes is 83.\n\nBut hold on, could it be more? Let me think. Is the division exact, or do I need to round down? Because 1,245 divided by 15 is exactly 83, so there's no need to round anything. So, 83 boxes is the exact number.\n\nAlternatively, if I had a different number where the division didn't come out even, I would have to round down to the nearest whole number, because you can't have a fraction of a box.\n\nBut in this case, since 15*83 is exactly 1,245, which is the remaining weight capacity, it's safe to say 83 boxes is the maximum. So, the answer is 83.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is \\boxed{83}.\n</think>\n\nThe total weight limit of the bridge is 5,000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds. The additional weight that can be added without exceeding the bridge's limit is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n5000 - 3755 = 1245 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nEach box weighs 15 pounds.

Comme il s'agissait d'un fournisseur de services de livraison, celui-ci a majoré la facture de 25 % et a ajouté 3,00 $ de frais de livraison. Stéphane a également donné un pourboire de 4,00 $. En comptant les frais supplémentaires, quel a été le prix final de la commande de Stéphane ?", "answer": "57", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Stéphane ordered some grocery products online, and his final bill was $40.00. But then, the delivery service added some extra charges. Hmm, I need to calculate the total amount he ended up paying after all the additions.\n\nFirst, the problem says the delivery service increased the bill by 25%. I think that means they added 25% of the original $40.00 to the bill. So, let me calculate that. 25% of 40 is... well, 10% of 40 is 4, so 25% would be 4 times 2.5, which is 10. So, the delivery service added $10.00 as a surcharge.\n\nNext, there are $3.00 added for delivery fees. That seems straightforward. So, that's an additional $3.00 on top of the original bill and the 25% surcharge.\n\nThen, Stéphane gave a tip of $4.00. I assume this tip is in addition to everything else. So, that's another $4.00 to add.\n\nLet me summarize the components:\n\n1. Original bill: $40.00\n2. 25% surcharge: $10.00\n3. Delivery fees: $3.00\n4. Tip: $4.00\n\nNow, to find the total amount Stéphane paid, I need to add all these together. So, let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, add the original bill and the surcharge: $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.\n\nThen, add the delivery fees: $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.\n\nFinally, add the tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe original bill is $40.00. The delivery service added 25%, which is indeed $10.00. So, that brings it to $50.00. Then, $3.00 for delivery is added, making it $53.00. Then, he added a $4.00 tip, so the total becomes $57.00.\n\nIs there any chance that the tip is calculated on the total after surcharge and delivery fees? The problem says he gave a tip of $4.00, so I think that's a flat fee, not a percentage. So, adding it directly as $4.00 makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, just to be thorough, let's make sure that the 25% was only on the original bill. If the surcharge was 25%, is it on the original amount or on the amount after adding delivery fees? Hmm, the problem says the delivery service majoré la facture de 25%, which I think means they added 25% to the original bill. Otherwise, it would have specified. So, I think it's correct to calculate the 25% on the $40.00.\n\nSo, adding all together: $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes, when you have multiple charges, you have to consider the order in which they're applied. For example, if the delivery fees were added before calculating the surcharge, it might change the total. But in this case, the problem says the delivery service majoré la facture de 25% and added $3.00 delivery. It doesn't specify the order, but usually, such problems present the charges in the order they are applied. So, I think first the 25% is added to the original bill, then the $3.00, and then the tip.\n\nBut just to be safe, let's recalculate assuming that the delivery fees were added before the 25% surcharge. Would that make a difference?\n\nSo, original bill: $40.00\n\nAdd delivery fees: $40.00 + $3.00 = $43.00\n\nThen, 25% surcharge on the new amount: 25% of $43.00 is $10.75.\n\nThen, total before tip: $43.00 + $10.75 = $53.75\n\nThen, add the tip: $53.75 + $4.00 = $57.75\n\nHmm, that's a different total. But the problem says \"a majoré la facture de 25%\", which I think refers to the original facture, which was $40.00. So, I think the first calculation is correct, giving a total of $57.00.\n\nBut why does the problem mention \"en comptant les frais supplémentaires\"? That means \"including additional fees.\" So, perhaps the 25% is also considered a frais supplémentaire, along with the $3.00 and the tip. So, if we include all these, the total should be $57.00.\n\nAlternatively, if the 25% was on the total after adding the delivery fees, then it would be $57.75, but I think that's not the case.\n\nLet me think about the wording again: \"Sa facture finale s'élève à 40,00 $. Comme il s'agissait d'un fournisseur de services de livraison, celui-ci a majoré la facture de 25 % et a ajouté 3,00 $ de frais de livraison. Stéphane a également donné un pourboire de 4,00 $.\"\n\nSo, the original facture was $40.00. The delivery service added a 25% surcharge and $3.00 delivery fees. Then, Stéphane added a $4.00 tip.\n\nSo, the 25% was on the original $40.00, then $3.00, then $4.00 tip.\n\nSo, yeah, total is $40 + 25% of 40 ($10) + $3 + $4 = $57.\n\nWait, but if we interpret \"majoré la facture de 25%\" as increasing the bill by 25%, which could be on the total after adding delivery fees. But that would be a bit unusual, because usually, when a service adds a surcharge, it's on the original amount unless specified otherwise.\n\nBut since the problem is in French, perhaps the exact translation can help. \"Majoré la facture de 25%\" means increased the bill by 25%. So, it's ambiguous whether it's 25% of the original or 25% of the total. But since the delivery fees are a separate addition, it's likely that the 25% is on the original.\n\nBut to be absolutely thorough, let's do both calculations:\n\nCase 1: 25% on original $40, then add $3, then add $4.\n\nTotal = 40 + 10 + 3 + 4 = 57.\n\nCase 2: Add $3 to original, then 25% on that, then add $4.\n\nTotal = 40 + 3 = 43; 25% of 43 is 10.75; 43 + 10.75 = 53.75; 53.75 + 4 = 57.75.\n\nSo, depending on the interpretation, it's either $57 or $57.75.\n\nBut given the problem says \"majoré la facture de 25%\", which is a common way to say a surcharge on the original amount, I think $57 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if all the additional fees are considered as \"frais supplémentaires\", which are added after the surcharge, but the tip is separate.\n\nWait, the question is: \"En comptant les frais supplémentaires, quel a été le prix final de la commande de Stéphane ?\"\n\nSo, \"including the additional fees, what was the final price of the order.\"\n\nSo, the additional fees would be the 25% surcharge, the $3 delivery, and the $4 tip. So, all of these are added to the original $40.\n\nWait, but is the tip considered a \"frais supplémentaire\"? Or is it a separate payment?\n\nHmm, that's a good point. In some contexts, tips are not considered fees but rather voluntary payments. So, perhaps the \"frais supplémentaires\" refer only to the surcharge and the delivery fees.\n\nIn that case, the total would be $40 + 25% surcharge + $3 delivery = $53, and then adding the tip of $4, making it $57.\n\nBut if the tip is also considered a frais supplémentaire, then it's part of the additional fees, so the total would be $40 + 25% + $3 + $4 = $57.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the tip is not part of the frais supplémentaires, but the question says \"en comptant les frais supplémentaires\", so including the additional fees. So, the additional fees are the 25%, the $3, and the tip? Or just the 25% and the $3.\n\nThe problem statement is: \"Sa facture finale s'élève à 40,00 $. Comme il s'agissait d'un fournisseur de services de livraison, celui-ci a majoré la facture de 25 % et a ajouté 3,00 $ de frais de livraison. Stéphane a également donné un pourboire de 4,00 $.\"\n\nSo, the facture was 40. Then, the delivery service increased it by 25%, added 3$ delivery. Then, Stéphane gave a 4$ tip.\n\nSo, the 25% and 3$ are the additional fees from the delivery service, and the tip is an additional amount from Stéphane.\n\nSo, the question is: \"En comptant les frais supplémentaires, quel a été le prix final de la commande de Stéphane ?\"\n\nSo, including the additional fees, what was the final price.\n\nSo, the additional fees (frais supplémentaires) are the 25% and the 3$. The tip is also an additional payment, but it's given by Stéphane, not by the delivery service. So, the question is a bit ambiguous.\n\nIf \"frais supplémentaires\" refers only to what the delivery service added, then the total would be 40 + 25% + 3$ = 53$, and then adding the tip would make it 57$.\n\nBut the question is: \"En comptant les frais supplémentaires, quel a été le prix final de la commande de Stéphane ?\"\n\nSo, \"Including the additional fees, what was the final price of the order.\"\n\nSo, the \"additional fees\" (frais supplémentaires) would include all extra charges: the 25%, the 3$, and the tip.\n\nBut is the tip considered a \"frais supplémentaire\"? Or is it a separate thing? Because the tip is given by the customer, not the service provider.\n\nIn France, when you pay a bill, the tip is usually included in the total amount, but it's not a fee imposed by the service provider. So, perhaps the \"frais supplémentaires\" only refer to the 25% and the 3$.\n\nTherefore, the total amount would be 40 + 10 + 3 = 53$, and then the tip of 4$ is added on top, making the total 57$.\n\nBut if \"frais supplémentaires\" include all additional charges, including the tip, then it's 40 + 10 + 3 + 4 = 57$. So, either way, the total is 57$. Wait, that can't be.\n\nWait, no. If \"frais supplémentaires\" include everything, then the total would be 40 + 25% + 3 + 4 = 57$. If \"frais supplémentaires\" are only the 25% and 3$, then the total is 53 + 4 = 57$. So, in both interpretations, the total is 57$.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, regardless of whether the tip is considered a \"frais supplémentaire\" or not, the total ends up being $57.00.\n\nTherefore, the final price is $57.00.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, yeah, final answer is $57.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final price of Stéphane's order was \\boxed{57} dollars.\n</think>\n\nStéphane's original bill was $40.00.

Comme il s'agissait d'un fournisseur de services de livraison, celui-ci a majoré la facture de 25 % et a ajouté 3,00 $ de frais de livraison. Stéphane a également donné un pourboire de 4,00 $.\"\n\nSo, the facture was 40. Then, the delivery service increased it by 25%, added 3$ delivery. Then, Stéphane gave a 4$ tip.\n\nSo, the 25% and 3$ are the additional fees from the delivery service, and the tip is an additional amount from Stéphane.\n\nSo, the question is: \"En comptant les frais supplémentaires, quel a été le prix final de la commande de Stéphane ?\"\n\nSo, including the additional fees, what was the final price.\n\nSo, the additional fees (frais supplémentaires) are the 25% and the 3$. The tip is also an additional payment, but it's given by Stéphane, not by the delivery service. So, the question is a bit ambiguous.\n\nIf \"frais supplémentaires\" refers only to what the delivery service added, then the total would be 40 + 25% + 3$ = 53$, and then adding the tip would make it 57$.\n\nBut the question is: \"En comptant les frais supplémentaires, quel a été le prix final de la commande de Stéphane ?\"\n\nSo, \"Including the additional fees, what was the final price of the order.\"\n\nSo, the \"additional fees\" (frais supplémentaires) would include all extra charges: the 25%, the 3$, and the tip.\n\nBut is the tip considered a \"frais supplémentaire\"? Or is it a separate thing? Because the tip is given by the customer, not the service provider.\n\nIn France, when you pay a bill, the tip is usually included in the total amount, but it's not a fee imposed by the service provider. So, perhaps the \"frais supplémentaires\" only refer to the 25% and the 3$.\n\nTherefore, the total amount would be 40 + 10 + 3 = 53$, and then the tip of 4$ is added on top, making the total 57$.\n\nBut if \"frais supplémentaires\" include all additional charges, including the tip, then it's 40 + 10 + 3 + 4 = 57$. So, either way, the total is 57$. Wait, that can't be.\n\nWait, no. If \"frais supplémentaires\" include everything, then the total would be 40 + 25% + 3 + 4 = 57$. If \"frais supplémentaires\" are only the 25% and 3$, then the total is 53 + 4 = 57$. So, in both interpretations, the total is 57$.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, regardless of whether the tip is considered a \"frais supplémentaire\" or not, the total ends up being $57.00.\n\nTherefore, the final price is $57.00.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, yeah, final answer is $57.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final price of Stéphane's order was \\boxed{57} dollars.", "answer_pred": "Stéphane's original bill was $40.00.

So, the problem says there's a raspberry bush with 6 clusters, each containing 20 fruits. Additionally, there are 67 isolated and scattered fruits on the bush.

Since there are 6 clusters and each has 20 fruits, I can multiply 6 by 20 to get that number.

{"idx": 62, "question": "Si Marcy travaille pour la même entreprise pendant 40 ans, elle reçoit une pension de 50 000 $ par an. À partir de 20 ans de travail, elle a droit à 5 % de ce montant par an. En admettant qu'elle démissionne après 30 ans de service, quelle sera sa pension annuelle ?", "answer": "25000", "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out what Marcy's annual pension will be if she works for 30 years at the same company. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, it says that if she works for 40 years, she gets a pension of $50,000 per year. That's the maximum, I suppose. Then, it mentions that starting from 20 years of work, she is entitled to 5% of that amount per year. Hmm, so maybe the pension increases by 5% each year beyond 20 years? Or is it something else?\n\nWait, let me parse that again. \"À partir de 20 ans de travail, elle a droit à 5 % de ce montant par an.\" So, starting from 20 years of work, she is entitled to 5% of that amount per year. Maybe it means that after 20 years, she gets 5% more each additional year? So, each year beyond 20, she gains 5% towards the full pension.\n\nLet me think. If she works 40 years, which is 20 years more than 20, and she gets 5% per year, so 20 years times 5% would be 100%, which would explain why she gets the full $50,000. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the pension seems to be calculated as a percentage based on the number of years beyond 20. So, for each year beyond 20, she gets an additional 5% of the full pension. So, if she works 30 years, that's 10 years beyond 20. So, 10 years times 5% is 50%. Therefore, her pension would be 50% of $50,000, which is $25,000 per year.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. Is it 5% of the full pension for each year beyond 20, or is it 5% per year of the full pension? The way it's written is \"5 % de ce montant par an.\" So, \"5% of that amount per year.\" So, each additional year beyond 20, she gets an additional 5% of the full $50,000.\n\nSo, if she works 20 years, maybe she gets 0? Or does she get 5% starting from 20? Wait, the problem says \"À partir de 20 ans de travail,\" which translates to \"From 20 years of work,\" so starting at 20 years, she gets 5% per year. So, that means at 20 years, she gets 5%, at 21 years, 10%, and so on.\n\nWait, no, that can't be because if she works 40 years, which is 20 years beyond 20, 20 times 5% is 100%, which would mean she gets the full $50,000. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, for each year beyond 20, she gets an additional 5% of the full pension. So, if she works for 30 years, that's 10 years beyond 20. So, 10 times 5% is 50%, so 50% of $50,000 is $25,000 per year.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, 20 years: 0%? Or does 20 years correspond to 5%? The wording is a bit unclear. It says \"À partir de 20 ans de travail, elle a droit à 5 % de ce montant par an.\" So, starting from 20 years, she is entitled to 5% of that amount per year.\n\nDoes that mean that at 20 years, she starts getting 5% per year? So, her pension is calculated as 5% multiplied by the number of years beyond 20? So, for 20 years, she gets 0, and starting at 20, each year adds 5%? Or does it mean that from year 20 onward, each year contributes 5% toward the pension?\n\nWait, maybe a better way to think about it is that the pension is based on years of service, with the first 20 years giving her a base, and each subsequent year adding 5% of the full pension amount. So, if she works 40 years, she gets 20 years times 5%, which is 100%, meaning the full pension. If she works 30 years, that's 10 years times 5%, so 50% of the pension.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is Pension = (Number of years beyond 20) * 5% * Full pension. So, if she has 30 years, beyond 20 is 10, so 10 * 5% * 50,000.\n\nLet me calculate that: 10 * 0.05 = 0.5, so 0.5 * 50,000 = 25,000. So, that's consistent.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not misinterpreting. Maybe the 5% is not of the full amount, but of something else. But the problem says \"5% de ce montant,\" which refers to the $50,000. So, 5% of $50,000 is $2,500 per additional year beyond 20.\n\nSo, if she works 30 years, that's 10 additional years, so 10 * 2,500 = 25,000. So, that's $25,000 per year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different calculation. Maybe the pension is 5% of her final salary or something else, but the problem states that the full pension is $50,000, so it's probably based on that.\n\nWait, let me check the French again to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly. \"À partir de 20 ans de travail, elle a droit à 5 % de ce montant par an.\" So, \"Starting from 20 years of work, she is entitled to 5% of that amount per year.\" So, \"ce montant\" refers to the $50,000. So, she gets 5% of $50,000 for each year beyond 20.\n\nTherefore, for each year beyond 20, she gets an additional $2,500. So, 30 years is 10 years beyond 20, so 10 * $2,500 = $25,000. So, her pension would be $25,000 per year.\n\nAlternatively, if she worked 40 years, that's 20 years beyond 20, so 20 * $2,500 = $50,000, which matches the given full pension. So, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, yes, I think the calculation is correct. She worked 30 years, which is 10 years beyond 20, so 10 * 5% of $50,000 is $25,000.\n\nBut hold on, another interpretation could be that the 5% is compounded annually or something, but the problem doesn't mention anything about compounding, so it's likely simple addition each year.\n\nAnother way to think about it: perhaps the pension is calculated as (years of service / 40) * $50,000. But in that case, 30 years would give (30/40)*50,000 = 37,500. But that contradicts the information given about 5% per year beyond 20.\n\nSo, I think the initial interpretation is correct.\n\nTo recap:\n\n- Full pension: $50,000 after 40 years.\n\n- Starting from 20 years, each additional year gives 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500.\n\n- Therefore, 30 years is 10 additional years beyond 20, so 10 * $2,500 = $25,000.\n\nHence, her pension would be $25,000 per year.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. It seems straightforward once broken down. The key was understanding that the 5% is per year beyond 20 years, applied to the full pension amount. So, each year adds $2,500, and with 10 extra years, that's $25,000.\n\nYeah, I think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in that logic.\n\n**Final Answer**\nLa pension annuelle de Marcy sera de \\boxed{25000} dollars.\n</think>\n\nMarcy travaille pour la même entreprise pendant 30 ans. La pension annuelle maximale est de 50 000 $ après 40 ans de service.

Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, it says that if she works for 40 years, she gets a pension of $50,000 per year. That's the maximum, I suppose. Then, it mentions that starting from 20 years of work, she is entitled to 5% of that amount per year. Hmm, so maybe the pension increases by 5% each year beyond 20 years? Or is it something else?\n\nWait, let me parse that again. \"À partir de 20 ans de travail, elle a droit à 5 % de ce montant par an.\" So, starting from 20 years of work, she is entitled to 5% of that amount per year. Maybe it means that after 20 years, she gets 5% more each additional year? So, each year beyond 20, she gains 5% towards the full pension.\n\nLet me think. If she works 40 years, which is 20 years more than 20, and she gets 5% per year, so 20 years times 5% would be 100%, which would explain why she gets the full $50,000. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the pension seems to be calculated as a percentage based on the number of years beyond 20. So, for each year beyond 20, she gets an additional 5% of the full pension. So, if she works 30 years, that's 10 years beyond 20. So, 10 years times 5% is 50%. Therefore, her pension would be 50% of $50,000, which is $25,000 per year.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. Is it 5% of the full pension for each year beyond 20, or is it 5% per year of the full pension? The way it's written is \"5 % de ce montant par an.\" So, \"5% of that amount per year.\" So, each additional year beyond 20, she gets an additional 5% of the full $50,000.\n\nSo, if she works 20 years, maybe she gets 0? Or does she get 5% starting from 20? Wait, the problem says \"À partir de 20 ans de travail,\" which translates to \"From 20 years of work,\" so starting at 20 years, she gets 5% per year. So, that means at 20 years, she gets 5%, at 21 years, 10%, and so on.\n\nWait, no, that can't be because if she works 40 years, which is 20 years beyond 20, 20 times 5% is 100%, which would mean she gets the full $50,000. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, for each year beyond 20, she gets an additional 5% of the full pension. So, if she works for 30 years, that's 10 years beyond 20. So, 10 times 5% is 50%, so 50% of $50,000 is $25,000 per year.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, 20 years: 0%? Or does 20 years correspond to 5%? The wording is a bit unclear. It says \"À partir de 20 ans de travail, elle a droit à 5 % de ce montant par an.\" So, starting from 20 years, she is entitled to 5% of that amount per year.\n\nDoes that mean that at 20 years, she starts getting 5% per year? So, her pension is calculated as 5% multiplied by the number of years beyond 20? So, for 20 years, she gets 0, and starting at 20, each year adds 5%? Or does it mean that from year 20 onward, each year contributes 5% toward the pension?\n\nWait, maybe a better way to think about it is that the pension is based on years of service, with the first 20 years giving her a base, and each subsequent year adding 5% of the full pension amount. So, if she works 40 years, she gets 20 years times 5%, which is 100%, meaning the full pension. If she works 30 years, that's 10 years times 5%, so 50% of the pension.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is Pension = (Number of years beyond 20) * 5% * Full pension. So, if she has 30 years, beyond 20 is 10, so 10 * 5% * 50,000.\n\nLet me calculate that: 10 * 0.05 = 0.5, so 0.5 * 50,000 = 25,000. So, that's consistent.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not misinterpreting. Maybe the 5% is not of the full amount, but of something else. But the problem says \"5% de ce montant,\" which refers to the $50,000. So, 5% of $50,000 is $2,500 per additional year beyond 20.\n\nSo, if she works 30 years, that's 10 additional years, so 10 * 2,500 = 25,000. So, that's $25,000 per year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different calculation. Maybe the pension is 5% of her final salary or something else, but the problem states that the full pension is $50,000, so it's probably based on that.\n\nWait, let me check the French again to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly. \"À partir de 20 ans de travail, elle a droit à 5 % de ce montant par an.\" So, \"Starting from 20 years of work, she is entitled to 5% of that amount per year.\" So, \"ce montant\" refers to the $50,000. So, she gets 5% of $50,000 for each year beyond 20.\n\nTherefore, for each year beyond 20, she gets an additional $2,500. So, 30 years is 10 years beyond 20, so 10 * $2,500 = $25,000. So, her pension would be $25,000 per year.\n\nAlternatively, if she worked 40 years, that's 20 years beyond 20, so 20 * $2,500 = $50,000, which matches the given full pension. So, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, yes, I think the calculation is correct. She worked 30 years, which is 10 years beyond 20, so 10 * 5% of $50,000 is $25,000.\n\nBut hold on, another interpretation could be that the 5% is compounded annually or something, but the problem doesn't mention anything about compounding, so it's likely simple addition each year.\n\nAnother way to think about it: perhaps the pension is calculated as (years of service / 40) * $50,000.

Si la société de streaming a facturé ce montant pendant la première moitié de l'année, puis 10 % de moins durant l'autre moitié de l'année, calculez le montant total qu'elle a payé pour le service de streaming à la fin de l'année.", "answer": "1596", "raw_response": "Okay, so Aleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges $140 per month. The company billed her this amount for the first half of the year. Then, for the second half of the year, they charged 10% less. I need to figure out how much she paid in total by the end of the year.\n\nLet me break this down step by step. First, understanding the problem is crucial. She pays $140 each month for the first six months. Then, for the next six months, her monthly fee decreases by 10%. So, I need to calculate the total for the first half, the total for the second half, and then add them together.\n\nStarting with the first half of the year. There are six months, and each month she pays $140. So, that should be 6 multiplied by 140. Let me write that down:\n\nFirst half total = 6 * 140.\n\nHmm, calculating that... 6 times 100 is 600, and 6 times 40 is 240. So, 600 + 240 equals 840. So, the first half of the year, she paid $840.\n\nNow, moving on to the second half of the year. The charge is 10% less than $140. So, I need to find 10% of 140 and then subtract that from 140 to get the new monthly rate.\n\nCalculating 10% of 140: 10% is the same as 0.10, so 0.10 * 140. Let me compute that. 0.10 times 100 is 10, and 0.10 times 40 is 4, so 10 + 4 is 14. So, the discount is $14.\n\nTherefore, the new monthly rate for the second half is 140 - 14. That’s 126. So, each month, she pays $126 for the next six months.\n\nNow, to find the total for the second half, I need to multiply 126 by 6. Let me do that. 100 times 6 is 600, and 26 times 6 is 156. So, 600 + 156 is 756. So, the second half total is $756.\n\nNow, to get the annual total, I have to add the first half and the second half together. So, 840 + 756. Let me compute that. 800 + 700 is 1500, and 40 + 56 is 96. So, 1500 + 96 is 1596.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that addition because 840 + 756... Hmm, 840 plus 700 is 1540, and then plus 56 is 1596. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can add 840 and 756 another way. 840 + 700 is 1540, and then 1540 + 56 is 1596. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Aleena paid $840 for the first six months and $756 for the second six months, totaling $1596 for the entire year.\n\nLet me recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The first half: 6 months at $140 each. That's straightforward. The second half, they took off 10%, which we calculated as $14, so the new rate is $126. Multiplying that by six months gives the total for the second half. Adding both halves together gives the annual total.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe calculating the total for the year directly without splitting it into halves? Let me think.\n\nWell, the first six months are at the original rate, and the last six months are at a discounted rate. So, it's necessary to calculate each period separately and then sum them up. I don't think there's a way around that unless we can find a combined rate or something, but since the rates are different for different periods, splitting them makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total as 6 times 140 plus 6 times (140 minus 10% of 140). Which is essentially the same approach as before. So, yes, same result.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll do the calculations again quickly:\n\nFirst half: 6 * 140 = 840.\n\nSecond half: 10% of 140 is 14, so 140 - 14 = 126. Then, 6 * 126 = 756.\n\nTotal: 840 + 756 = 1596.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to verify is to compute the monthly rates and see if the total adds up. Maybe even compute the total as 12 months with adjusted rates.\n\nWait, let's try that. The first six months are $140 each, so that's 6 months. The next six months are $126 each. So, total is (6 * 140) + (6 * 126). Which is the same as above.\n\nAlternatively, can I factor out the 6? So, 6*(140 + 126) = 6*266. Wait, 140 + 126 is 266. 6*266. Let's compute that. 200*6=1200, 60*6=360, 6*6=36. So, 1200 + 360 is 1560, plus 36 is 1596. So, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each half separately or factor out the number of months, I still get $1596.\n\nIs there a chance I made a mistake in computing the 10% discount? Let me check that again. 10% of 140 is 14, so 140 - 14 is 126. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes when discounts are applied, people might get confused between multiplying by 0.9 or subtracting 10%. But in this case, 10% less is just subtracting 10% of the original amount, so 140 - 14 is correct.\n\nAnother way to express the second half rate is 140 multiplied by 0.9, which is 126. That makes sense because 0.9 is 90% of the original price.\n\nSo, 140 * 0.9 = 126. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, both calculations for the second half are consistent.\n\nSo, to recap, first six months: 6 * 140 = 840. Second six months: 6 * 126 = 756. Total: 840 + 756 = 1596.\n\nTherefore, Aleena paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year.\n\nJust to ensure that I haven't missed any other costs or potential fees, the problem only mentions the monthly charge and a 10% reduction for the second half of the year. There's no mention of any additional fees or taxes, so I can safely assume that the total is just the sum of the two halves.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that Aleena paid $1596 in total for the streaming service over the year.\n\n**Final Answer**\nLe montant total payé par Aleena est de \\boxed{1596} dollars.\n</think>\n\nAleena s'est abonnée à un service de streaming qui lui facture 140 $ par mois.

{"idx": 64, "question": "Sophie envisage un voyage en voiture et se demande quelle distance elle peut parcourir avec un seul plein d'essence. Elle a fait 100 miles depuis le dernier plein et a dû rajouter 4 gallons d'essence pour remplir à nouveau le réservoir. Le manuel d'utilisation indique que son réservoir a une capacité de 12 galons d'essence. Combien de miles Sophie peut-elle parcourir avec un seul plein d'essence ?", "answer": "300", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to figure out how far Sophie can drive on a full tank of gas. Hmm, so she drove 100 miles since her last fill-up and then had to add 4 gallons to fill the tank again. The manual says the tank can hold 12 gallons. I need to find out her mileage per gallon and then multiply that by the tank capacity to get the total distance she can drive on a full tank.\n\nFirst, I think I should determine how much gas she used for those 100 miles. She added 4 gallons to refill the tank, which means she used 4 gallons to drive 100 miles, right? So, if she used 4 gallons for 100 miles, her mileage per gallon would be 100 miles divided by 4 gallons. Let me write that down:\n\nMiles per gallon (mpg) = Total miles driven / Total gas used\nmpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons\nmpg = 25 miles per gallon\n\nOkay, so she gets 25 miles per gallon. Now, if her tank can hold 12 gallons, then the total distance she can drive on a full tank would be her mileage per gallon multiplied by the tank capacity. Let me calculate that:\n\nTotal distance = mpg * Tank capacity\nTotal distance = 25 mpg * 12 gallons\nTotal distance = 300 miles\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. She used 4 gallons for 100 miles, so 100 divided by 4 is indeed 25 mpg. Then 25 multiplied by 12 gallons is 300. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nBut hold on, is there another way to think about this? Maybe considering the fraction of the tank she used? She had to add 4 gallons to fill it up, which suggests that she had 8 gallons left in the tank before she added the 4 gallons. Wait, no, actually, the tank capacity is 12 gallons, so if she added 4 gallons to fill it up, that means she had 12 - 4 = 8 gallons before she added the gas. So she used 8 gallons to drive 100 miles?\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify. If the tank can hold 12 gallons, and she added 4 gallons to fill it, that means she had 12 - 4 = 8 gallons in the tank before she filled up. So, she had 8 gallons left when she started driving, and after driving 100 miles, she needed 4 gallons to refill. So, the amount of gas she used for 100 miles was 8 gallons, not 4 gallons. Hmm, that changes things.\n\nWait, no, actually, if she had 8 gallons before she started driving, and after driving 100 miles, she had to add 4 gallons to fill the tank, that means she used 8 gallons to drive 100 miles. Because she had 8, drove 100 miles, and then needed 4 more to get back to 12. So, gas used is 8 gallons for 100 miles.\n\nSo, recalculate the mileage per gallon:\n\nmpg = 100 miles / 8 gallons\nmpg = 12.5 mpg\n\nOh, that's different. So, if she gets 12.5 miles per gallon, then on a full tank of 12 gallons, she can drive:\n\nTotal distance = 12.5 mpg * 12 gallons = 150 miles\n\nBut wait, that contradicts my initial thought. So which is it? Did she use 4 gallons or 8 gallons for 100 miles?\n\nLet me think again. When she filled up, she added 4 gallons to make it full. So, the amount of gas she used since the last fill-up is equal to the amount she had to add now to fill it up. So, if she added 4 gallons, that means she used 4 gallons since the last fill-up.\n\nBut if the tank capacity is 12 gallons, and she had some gas left before she filled up, then the gas used is equal to the amount she added. So, gas used = 4 gallons for 100 miles.\n\nSo, mpg = 100 / 4 = 25 mpg.\n\nTherefore, on a full tank, she can drive 25 * 12 = 300 miles.\n\nBut then why did I think she had 8 gallons left? Maybe that's another way to interpret it, but I think the correct approach is that the gas used is equal to the gas added to refill. So, gas used = gas added = 4 gallons.\n\nSo, let me confirm: If she had a full tank of 12 gallons, drove some distance, and then had to add 4 gallons to refill, that means she used 4 gallons. Therefore, 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 mpg. So, full tank would be 25 * 12 = 300 miles.\n\nAlternatively, if she had 8 gallons left, and then added 4 gallons to make it 12, but that would mean she had 8 gallons before driving, used all 8 gallons for 100 miles, which seems unlikely because then mpg would be low.\n\nWait, no, if she had 8 gallons before driving, and then added 4 gallons after driving 100 miles, it means she used 8 gallons to drive 100 miles. But that would mean she started with 8 gallons, ended with 0, and added 4 gallons? That doesn't make sense because she added 4 gallons to refill, so she didn't end with 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is about whether the 4 gallons she added refilled the tank or just topped it off.\n\nIf she had some gas left, say x gallons, drove 100 miles, and then added 4 gallons to make it full again. So, the gas used is x gallons, which is equal to 12 - (x + 4) ?\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the amount of gas used.\n\nWhen she filled up, she added 4 gallons to make it full. So, the gas used since the last fill-up is 4 gallons. Therefore, she used 4 gallons to drive 100 miles.\n\nSo, mpg = 100 / 4 = 25.\n\nTherefore, on a full tank of 12 gallons, she can drive 12 * 25 = 300 miles.\n\nI think that's the correct way to look at it. Because the gas she added is equal to the gas she used since the last fill-up. So, the distance per gallon is 25, times 12 gallons gives 300 miles.\n\nAlternatively, if she had 8 gallons before driving, drove 100 miles, and then added 4 gallons to refill, that would mean she used 8 gallons for 100 miles, which would be 12.5 mpg. But that seems contradictory because if she had 8 gallons, then she didn't start with a full tank.\n\nBut the problem says she had to add 4 gallons to refill the tank after driving 100 miles. So, that suggests that she started with a full tank, drove 100 miles, then added 4 gallons to refill. Therefore, she used 4 gallons for 100 miles.\n\nWait, but if she started with a full tank, drove 100 miles, and then added 4 gallons to refill, that would mean she used 4 gallons for 100 miles, so 25 mpg, and a full tank is 12 gallons, so 300 miles.\n\nAlternatively, if she didn't start with a full tank, but just drove until she needed to add 4 gallons to refill, then we don't know how much she had before, which complicates things.\n\nBut the problem says she had to add 4 gallons to refill the tank after driving 100 miles. So, that implies that she started with a full tank, drove 100 miles, then had to add 4 gallons to make it full again.\n\nWait, no, actually, if she started with a full tank, then drove 100 miles, she would have 12 - (gas used) gallons left. Then she added 4 gallons to make it full again, so gas used is 4 gallons.\n\nSo, yes, gas used = 4 gallons, distance = 100 miles, so mpg = 25. Then total range on full tank is 25 * 12 = 300 miles.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 300 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\nSophie peut parcourir \\boxed{300} miles avec un seul plein d'essence.\n</think>\n\nSophie a conduit 100 miles depuis son dernier plein d'essence et a dû ajouter 4 gallons pour remplir à nouveau le réservoir.

Combien d'heures passe-t-il à regarder la télévision et à lire en 4 semaines ?", "answer": "36", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then decides to go to bed and read for half the time he spent watching TV. He does this 3 times a week. We need to find out how many hours he spends watching TV and reading in 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given. Every time Jim does this activity, he spends 2 hours watching TV. Then, he reads for half the time he watched TV. So, if he watches TV for 2 hours, he reads for half of that, which is 1 hour. So, each session consists of 2 hours of TV and 1 hour of reading. That means per session, he spends a total of 3 hours on these activities.\n\nNow, he repeats this 3 times a week. So, each week, he does 3 sessions. Each session is 3 hours, so for one week, that would be 3 sessions multiplied by 3 hours per session. Let me calculate that: 3 times 3 is 9 hours per week.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me verify that. Each session is 2 hours TV + 1 hour reading, which is 3 hours. If he does this 3 times a week, then the total time spent each week is 3 sessions times 3 hours per session, which is indeed 9 hours per week. So, 9 hours per week.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much time he spends over 4 weeks. So, 9 hours per week multiplied by 4 weeks. Let me compute that: 9 times 4 is 36 hours.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the total TV time and total reading time separately and then add them together.\n\nLet's see.

Over 4 weeks: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.\n\nYes, same result. So, I think 36 hours is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for separate totals for TV and reading?

{"idx": 66, "question": "Un tournoi de basket-ball accueille quatre écoles en compétition. Chaque école a envoyé une équipe féminine et une équipe masculine, chacune comptant 5 joueurs. Les écoles ont également envoyé chacune un entraîneur. Combien de personnes les écoles ont-elles envoyées en tout ?", "answer": "48", "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem about a basketball tournament with four schools. Each school has sent a women's team and a men's team, each consisting of 5 players. Additionally, each school has sent one coach. I need to figure out the total number of people that all the schools have sent to the tournament. \n\nLet me break this down step by step. First, let's consider one school. Each school sends two teams: one women's team and one men's team. Each of these teams has 5 players. So, for one school, that's 5 players (women) plus 5 players (men). Let me write that down: 5 + 5 = 10 players per school.\n\nBut wait, there's also a coach from each school. So, for each school, in addition to the players, there's one coach. That means per school, the total number of people is the number of players plus the coach. So, 10 players + 1 coach = 11 people per school.\n\nNow, since there are four schools participating, I need to multiply the number of people per school by the number of schools. So, 11 people per school times 4 schools. Let me calculate that: 11 x 4. Hmm, 10 x 4 is 40, and 1 x 4 is 4, so 40 + 4 = 44. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem mentions four schools, each sending a women's team, a men's team, and a coach. Each team has 5 players. So, for each school, it's 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 people, as I thought. Then, multiplying by four gives 44. That seems right.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by calculating the total number of players first and then adding the coaches. So, for each school, 5 women + 5 men = 10 players. Four schools would have 10 x 4 = 40 players. Then, the coaches: 1 per school, so 4 coaches. Adding them together: 40 + 4 = 44 people. Yep, same result.\n\nI don't think I'm overcomplicating this. It's straightforward multiplication and addition. Each school contributes a fixed number of people, so scaling it up by the number of schools gives the total. \n\nJust to visualize, let's imagine each school as a unit. School A sends 10 players and 1 coach, that's 11. School B does the same, 11, School C, 11, and School D, 11. So, four schools, each contributing 11, so 4 x 11 is 44. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to break it down into parts: women's teams, men's teams, and coaches. The total number of women's players is 5 per school, 4 schools, so 5 x 4 = 20. Similarly, men's players are also 5 x 4 = 20. Coaches are 1 x 4 = 4. So, 20 + 20 + 4 = 44. \n\nYeah, that's consistent. So, all these different ways of calculating lead me to the same number, 44. I think that's solid. \n\nI don't see any hidden details or anything tricky in the problem. It's just a matter of adding up the players and coaches from each school and then scaling it by the number of schools. \n\nJust to be thorough, let me check the addition and multiplication. 5 players on the women's team, 5 on the men's. So, that's 10 per school. 4 schools, so 10 x 4 = 40 players. Then, 1 coach per school, 4 coaches total. 40 + 4 = 44. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider each coach as an additional person beyond the two teams, then each school has 10 players + 1 coach = 11. 11 x 4 = 44. \n\nSo, yeah, 44 is the total number of people sent by all the schools. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of people sent by all the schools is \\boxed{44}.\n</think>\n\nEach school sends a women's team, a men's team, and a coach.

Each school has sent a women's team and a men's team, each consisting of 5 players. Additionally, each school has sent one coach. I need to figure out the total number of people that all the schools have sent to the tournament. \n\nLet me break this down step by step. First, let's consider one school. Each school sends two teams: one women's team and one men's team. Each of these teams has 5 players. So, for one school, that's 5 players (women) plus 5 players (men). Let me write that down: 5 + 5 = 10 players per school.\n\nBut wait, there's also a coach from each school. So, for each school, in addition to the players, there's one coach. That means per school, the total number of people is the number of players plus the coach. So, 10 players + 1 coach = 11 people per school.\n\nNow, since there are four schools participating, I need to multiply the number of people per school by the number of schools. So, 11 people per school times 4 schools. Let me calculate that: 11 x 4. Hmm, 10 x 4 is 40, and 1 x 4 is 4, so 40 + 4 = 44. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem mentions four schools, each sending a women's team, a men's team, and a coach. Each team has 5 players. So, for each school, it's 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 people, as I thought. Then, multiplying by four gives 44. That seems right.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by calculating the total number of players first and then adding the coaches. So, for each school, 5 women + 5 men = 10 players. Four schools would have 10 x 4 = 40 players. Then, the coaches: 1 per school, so 4 coaches. Adding them together: 40 + 4 = 44 people. Yep, same result.\n\nI don't think I'm overcomplicating this. It's straightforward multiplication and addition. Each school contributes a fixed number of people, so scaling it up by the number of schools gives the total. \n\nJust to visualize, let's imagine each school as a unit. School A sends 10 players and 1 coach, that's 11. School B does the same, 11, School C, 11, and School D, 11. So, four schools, each contributing 11, so 4 x 11 is 44. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to break it down into parts: women's teams, men's teams, and coaches. The total number of women's players is 5 per school, 4 schools, so 5 x 4 = 20. Similarly, men's players are also 5 x 4 = 20. Coaches are 1 x 4 = 4. So, 20 + 20 + 4 = 44. \n\nYeah, that's consistent.

The chest contains 175 diamonds. That's straightforward. Next, it says there are 35 rubies less than the number of diamonds. So if there are 175 diamonds, then the number of rubies must be 175 minus 35. Let me write that down:\n\nNumber of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35\nNumber of rubies = 175 - 35\n\nHmm, 175 minus 35.

So per class, that's 15 * 15. Let me compute that. 15 times 15 is 225. So, each class brings in $225.\n\nNow, how many classes does she teach in a week? She teaches 5 classes each day from Monday to Friday, so that's 5 days * 5 classes per day. Let me compute that: 5*5=25 classes during the week. Then, on Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. So total classes in the week are 25 + 8 = 33 classes.\n\nSo, if each class brings in $225, then total revenue is 33 * 225. Let me calculate that.\n\nHmm, 33 multiplied by 225. Let me do 30*225 + 3*225. 30*225 is 6,750, and 3*225 is 675. So, 6,750 + 675 = 7,425. So, total revenue is $7,425 per week.\n\nWait, let me try the other approach to make sure.\n\nSecond approach: Total number of students per week.\n\nEach class has 15 students, so during the week, 25 classes, so 25*15 students. On Saturday, 8 classes, so 8*15 students. Then, total students in the week are 25*15 + 8*15.\n\nCalculating that: 25*15 is 375, and 8*15 is 120. So, total students is 375 + 120 = 495 students.\n\nEach student pays $15, so total revenue is 495 * 15. Let me compute that.\n\n495 * 15. Hmm, I can think of 500 * 15 = 7,500, but since it's 495, which is 5 less, so 5*15=75. So, 7,500 - 75 = 7,425. So, same result, $7,425.\n\nOkay, so that seems consistent. So, whether I calculate per class or total students, I get the same amount. So, Judy makes $7,425 a week.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me parse the problem again.\n\n\"En semaine, Judy donne 5 cours de danse tous les jours et 8 cours le samedi.\" So, during the week, 5 classes every day, and 8 classes on Saturday. So, \"en semaine\" typically refers to Monday to Friday, right? So, that's 5 classes each day for 5 days, which is 25 classes. Then, on Saturday, which is also part of the week in some contexts, but in school terms, sometimes the week is Monday to Friday. But the problem says \"en semaine\" and then separately mentions Saturday. So, perhaps the total week here is Monday to Saturday? Or is Saturday considered separate?\n\nWait, so \"en semaine\" is during the week, which is typically Monday to Friday. Then, \"et 8 cours le samedi,\" which is 8 classes on Saturday. So, that would be in addition to the 5 classes per day during the week.\n\nTherefore, the total number of classes is 5 classes/day * 5 days + 8 classes on Saturday = 25 + 8 = 33 classes.\n\nSo, yes, total classes are 33. Each class is 15 students, so total students are 33*15=495. Each student pays $15, so 495*15=7,425.\n\nAlternatively, 33 classes * (15 students/class * $15/student) = 33*225=7,425.\n\nWait, just to make sure, is there a possibility that \"en semaine\" includes Saturday? But in French, \"en semaine\" is usually Monday to Friday, and Saturday is \"le samedi.\" So, Saturday is separate.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way: per day earnings.\n\nFrom Monday to Friday: 5 classes/day, each class $225, so 5*225=1,125 per day. So, for 5 days, that's 5*1,125=5,625.\n\nOn Saturday: 8 classes, each $225, so 8*225=1,800.\n\nTotal for the week: 5,625 + 1,800 = 7,425. Same result.\n\nSo, yes, consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is $7,425 per week.\n\n**Final Answer**\nJudy gagne \\boxed{7425} dollars en une semaine.\n</think>\n\nJudy donne 5 cours de danse chaque jour du lundi au vendredi et 8 cours le samedi.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that during the week, Judy gives 5 dance classes every day. And then on Saturday, she gives 8 courses. I think that means she gives 8 classes on Saturday. I should confirm if that's per day or in total, but the way it's phrased seems like 8 classes on Saturday. So, during the week, Monday to Friday, she gives 5 classes each day, and on Saturday, she gives 8.\n\nNext, each class has 15 students. So, for each class, there are 15 kids. And she charges $15 per student.

Let me do 30*225 + 3*225. 30*225 is 6,750, and 3*225 is 675. So, 6,750 + 675 = 7,425.

So, total students is 375 + 120 = 495 students.\n\nEach student pays $15, so total revenue is 495 * 15. Let me compute that.\n\n495 * 15.

Each brownie slice is sold for $3 and each cheesecake slice is sold for $4. He sold 43 brownies and 23 cheesecake slices. I need to figure out how much money Tommy has collected in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the total money made from the brownies. Since each brownie is $3 and he sold 43 of them, I can multiply 3 by 43. Let me write that down: 3 * 43. Hmm, 3 times 40 is 120, and 3 times 3 is 9, so adding those together, that's 120 + 9 = 129.

{"idx": 73, "question": "Shiela a acheté cinq téléphones portables au prix de 150 $ chacun, payable en 3 mensualités. Un intérêt de 2 % sera facturé pour chaque unité. Quel montant Shiela devra-t-elle verser chaque mois pendant 3 mois ?", "answer": "255", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to figure out how much Shiela has to pay each month for the cell phones. So, she bought five phones, each costing $150. Hmm, first I should calculate the total cost before any interest, right? If each phone is $150 and she bought five, then the total cost is 5 multiplied by 150. Let me write that down: 5 × 150. Hmm, 5 times 100 is 500, and 5 times 50 is 250, so 500 + 250 equals 750. Okay, so the total cost before interest is $750.\n\nNow, it says it's payable in 3 monthly installments. So, she's going to pay this amount over three months. But wait, there's also an interest of 2% charged for each unit. Hmm, okay, so each phone has a 2% interest. Since she bought five phones, does that mean each phone has 2% interest, or is it 2% on the total amount? Hmm, the wording says \"pour chaque unité,\" which is French for \"for each unit.\" So, maybe each phone has a 2% interest. Let me think about that.\n\nIf each phone has a 2% interest, then for each phone, the interest would be 2% of $150. Let me calculate that. 2% of 150 is 0.02 × 150, which is 3 dollars. So, each phone has an interest of $3. Since she bought five phones, the total interest would be 5 × 3, which is $15. So, total amount she has to pay is the original amount plus the interest. That would be 750 + 15, which is $765.\n\nAlternatively, if the 2% interest was on the total amount, then the interest would be 2% of $750. Let me check that too. 2% of 750 is 0.02 × 750, which is $15. So, in both cases, the total interest is $15. So, whether it's per unit or on the total, the interest is the same. Interesting.\n\nSo, the total amount she has to pay is $765, and she has to pay this over 3 months. So, to find out how much she pays each month, I need to divide 765 by 3. Let me calculate that: 765 ÷ 3. Well, 3 goes into 7 two times, making 6, subtract 6 from 7, bring down the 6 to make 16. 3 goes into 16 five times, making 15, subtract 15 from 16, bring down the 5. 3 goes into 15 five times. So, that gives me 255. So, each month, she has to pay $255.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake there. So, total cost is $750, plus $15 interest, total $765. Divided by 3 months is $255 per month. Yeah, that seems right. So, Shiela will have to pay $255 each month for three months.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the interest is compounded monthly? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify if it's simple interest or compound interest. It just says an interest of 2% will be charged for each unit. So, maybe it's simple interest. If it's simple interest, then it's 2% per unit, which we've already calculated as $3 per phone, totaling $15.\n\nIf it were compound interest, that would be a different calculation, but since the problem doesn't specify, I think simple interest is the way to go. So, I think my initial calculation stands.\n\nAnother way to look at it: each month, she's paying a portion of the principal plus the interest. But since it's three monthly installments and the total interest is $15, maybe the interest is spread out over the three months. Wait, no. The total interest is $15 regardless of the payment plan.\n\nWait, but in reality, if you have installments, sometimes the interest is calculated on the remaining balance each month. So, maybe I should calculate it that way. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, if she pays $255 each month, how does the principal and interest break down each month? Let's see. The total amount is $750, with $15 interest, but if we think of it as an installment plan, the interest might be applied monthly on the remaining balance.\n\nBut the problem says \"un intérêt de 2 % sera facturé pour chaque unité,\" which I think translates to a 2% interest charged per unit. So, maybe it's a one-time interest fee per unit, not a monthly interest. So, in that case, the total interest is 5 × 150 × 0.02 = 15, as we calculated before. So, the total amount is 750 + 15 = 765, which is divided by 3, so 255 per month.\n\nAlternatively, if it's 2% per month on the outstanding balance, then it would be a different calculation. Let's explore that.\n\nFirst, total principal is $750. If the interest is 2% per month, then each month, the interest is calculated on the remaining balance. So, let's see.\n\nFirst month: she pays $255. The interest for the first month would be 2% of 750, which is $15. So, the payment would cover the interest of $15, and the remaining $240 would go towards the principal. So, the principal after first month is 750 - 240 = 510.\n\nSecond month: the interest is 2% of 510, which is 10.20. So, she pays $255, which covers $10.20 in interest and $244.80 towards the principal. So, the principal after second month is 510 - 244.80 = 265.20.\n\nThird month: interest is 2% of 265.20, which is approximately 5.30. She pays $255, which covers $5.30 in interest and $249.70 towards the principal. So, the total amount paid is 255 × 3 = 765.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the total interest paid would be 15 + 10.20 + 5.30 = 30.50. Which is more than the $15 we calculated before. But the problem said \"un intérêt de 2 % sera facturé pour chaque unité.\" So, that seems to imply a one-time interest per unit, not a monthly compounded interest.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to calculate a flat interest of 2% on each unit, totaling $15, and then divide the total amount of $765 into three equal monthly payments of $255 each.\n\nSo, Shiela has to pay $255 each month for three months.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I should consider another perspective. If it's 2% per month, but the problem didn't specify whether it's simple or compound. But since it says \"pour chaque unité,\" meaning per unit, I think it's a one-time interest per unit. So, 2% of 150 per phone, which is 3 dollars per phone, times five phones, so 15 in total.\n\nTherefore, adding that to 750 gives 765, and dividing by three gives 255.\n\nAlternatively, is there another way to interpret \"pour chaque unité\"? Maybe 2% per month per unit? Then it would be a different calculation.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the period, just \"un intérêt de 2 % sera facturé pour chaque unité.\" So, it's a bit ambiguous. But in financial terms, if it's not specified, it's often simple interest. So, I think 2% as a one-time interest per unit is the correct interpretation.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is $255 per month.\n\n**Final Answer**\nShiela devra verser \\boxed{255} dollars chaque mois.\n</think>\n\nShiela acheté cinq téléphones portables au prix de 150 $ chacun, payable en 3 mensualités.

So, she bought five phones, each costing $150. Hmm, first I should calculate the total cost before any interest, right? If each phone is $150 and she bought five, then the total cost is 5 multiplied by 150. Let me write that down: 5 × 150. Hmm, 5 times 100 is 500, and 5 times 50 is 250, so 500 + 250 equals 750. Okay, so the total cost before interest is $750.\n\nNow, it says it's payable in 3 monthly installments. So, she's going to pay this amount over three months. But wait, there's also an interest of 2% charged for each unit. Hmm, okay, so each phone has a 2% interest. Since she bought five phones, does that mean each phone has 2% interest, or is it 2% on the total amount? Hmm, the wording says \"pour chaque unité,\" which is French for \"for each unit.\" So, maybe each phone has a 2% interest. Let me think about that.\n\nIf each phone has a 2% interest, then for each phone, the interest would be 2% of $150. Let me calculate that. 2% of 150 is 0.02 × 150, which is 3 dollars. So, each phone has an interest of $3. Since she bought five phones, the total interest would be 5 × 3, which is $15. So, total amount she has to pay is the original amount plus the interest. That would be 750 + 15, which is $765.\n\nAlternatively, if the 2% interest was on the total amount, then the interest would be 2% of $750. Let me check that too. 2% of 750 is 0.02 × 750, which is $15. So, in both cases, the total interest is $15. So, whether it's per unit or on the total, the interest is the same. Interesting.\n\nSo, the total amount she has to pay is $765, and she has to pay this over 3 months. So, to find out how much she pays each month, I need to divide 765 by 3. Let me calculate that: 765 ÷ 3. Well, 3 goes into 7 two times, making 6, subtract 6 from 7, bring down the 6 to make 16. 3 goes into 16 five times, making 15, subtract 15 from 16, bring down the 5. 3 goes into 15 five times. So, that gives me 255. So, each month, she has to pay $255.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake there. So, total cost is $750, plus $15 interest, total $765. Divided by 3 months is $255 per month. Yeah, that seems right. So, Shiela will have to pay $255 each month for three months.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the interest is compounded monthly? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify if it's simple interest or compound interest. It just says an interest of 2% will be charged for each unit. So, maybe it's simple interest. If it's simple interest, then it's 2% per unit, which we've already calculated as $3 per phone, totaling $15.\n\nIf it were compound interest, that would be a different calculation, but since the problem doesn't specify, I think simple interest is the way to go. So, I think my initial calculation stands.\n\nAnother way to look at it: each month, she's paying a portion of the principal plus the interest. But since it's three monthly installments and the total interest is $15, maybe the interest is spread out over the three months. Wait, no. The total interest is $15 regardless of the payment plan.\n\nWait, but in reality, if you have installments, sometimes the interest is calculated on the remaining balance each month. So, maybe I should calculate it that way. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, if she pays $255 each month, how does the principal and interest break down each month? Let's see. The total amount is $750, with $15 interest, but if we think of it as an installment plan, the interest might be applied monthly on the remaining balance.\n\nBut the problem says \"un intérêt de 2 % sera facturé pour chaque unité,\" which I think translates to a 2% interest charged per unit. So, maybe it's a one-time interest fee per unit, not a monthly interest. So, in that case, the total interest is 5 × 150 × 0.02 = 15, as we calculated before. So, the total amount is 750 + 15 = 765, which is divided by 3, so 255 per month.\n\nAlternatively, if it's 2% per month on the outstanding balance, then it would be a different calculation. Let's explore that.\n\nFirst, total principal is $750. If the interest is 2% per month, then each month, the interest is calculated on the remaining balance. So, let's see.\n\nFirst month: she pays $255. The interest for the first month would be 2% of 750, which is $15. So, the payment would cover the interest of $15, and the remaining $240 would go towards the principal. So, the principal after first month is 750 - 240 = 510.\n\nSecond month: the interest is 2% of 510, which is 10.20. So, she pays $255, which covers $10.20 in interest and $244.80 towards the principal. So, the principal after second month is 510 - 244.80 = 265.20.\n\nThird month: interest is 2% of 265.20, which is approximately 5.30. She pays $255, which covers $5.30 in interest and $249.70 towards the principal. So, the total amount paid is 255 × 3 = 765.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the total interest paid would be 15 + 10.20 + 5.30 = 30.50. Which is more than the $15 we calculated before. But the problem said \"un intérêt de 2 % sera facturé pour chaque unité.\" So, that seems to imply a one-time interest per unit, not a monthly compounded interest.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to calculate a flat interest of 2% on each unit, totaling $15, and then divide the total amount of $765 into three equal monthly payments of $255 each.\n\nSo, Shiela has to pay $255 each month for three months.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I should consider another perspective.

{"idx": 75, "question": "Luc passe du temps à construire des châteaux de sable sur la plage. Il remarque que chaque étage d'un château de sable a la moitié de la surface de l'étage inférieur. Quelle est la superficie moyenne d'un étage, sachant que le château de sable en compte 4 et que l'étage le plus élevé a une superficie de 16 pieds carrés ?", "answer": "60", "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem about Luc building sand castles. Each floor has half the area of the one below it. There are 4 floors, and the top floor has an area of 16 square feet. I need to find the average area per floor. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if each floor is half the area of the one below, then the areas form a geometric sequence. A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio. In this case, the common ratio is 1/2 because each floor is half the area of the one below.\n\nBut wait, the top floor is given as 16 square feet, and it's the fourth floor. So, if we think of the floors as going from top to bottom, each subsequent floor is double the area of the one above it. That means the ratio from top to bottom is 2, but from bottom to top, it's 1/2. So, depending on how we index the floors, the common ratio changes.\n\nLet me clarify: If the top floor is 16, the one below it would be 32, then 64, then 128? Wait, no, that can't be. Because if each floor is half the area of the one below, then starting from the top, each floor below would be double the area. So, starting from the top:\n\nFloor 4 (top): 16 sq ft\n\nFloor 3: 16 * 2 = 32 sq ft\n\nFloor 2: 32 * 2 = 64 sq ft\n\nFloor 1 (bottom): 64 * 2 = 128 sq ft\n\nSo, the areas of the floors, from bottom to top, are 128, 64, 32, 16 square feet.\n\nBut I need the average area per floor. So, I can compute the total area of all four floors and then divide by 4.\n\nTotal area = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16\n\nLet me add those up:\n\n128 + 64 = 192\n\n192 + 32 = 224\n\n224 + 16 = 240\n\nSo, total area is 240 square feet.\n\nAverage area per floor = total area / number of floors = 240 / 4 = 60.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a geometric series, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to calculate the total area.\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is:\n\nS_n = a_1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nWhere:\n- S_n is the sum of the first n terms\n- a_1 is the first term\n- r is the common ratio\n- n is the number of terms\n\nBut in this case, I know the last term, not the first term. So, maybe I need to express the sum differently.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the top floor as the first term, then the common ratio is 2, because each term below is double the one above.\n\nSo, if a_1 = 16 (top floor), r = 2, and n = 4.\n\nThen, the sum S_4 = a_1 * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1) = 16 * (2^4 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 16 * (16 - 1) / 1 = 16 * 15 = 240.\n\nSame result as before, so that's reassuring.\n\nSo, total area is 240, average is 240 / 4 = 60.\n\nTherefore, the average area per floor is 60 square feet.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the common ratio. Let me think again.\n\nIf each floor is half the area of the one below, starting from the bottom, then the sequence is 128, 64, 32, 16. So, from bottom to top, each term is multiplied by 1/2.\n\nSo, if I consider the bottom floor as the first term, a_1 = 128, r = 1/2, n = 4.\n\nSum S_4 = a_1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r) = 128 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2) = 128 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2) = 128 * (15/16) / (1/2) = 128 * (15/16) * 2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n128 * (15/16) = (128 / 16) * 15 = 8 * 15 = 120\n\n120 * 2 = 240\n\nAgain, same total area. So, whether I consider the top floor as the first term with ratio 2 or the bottom floor as the first term with ratio 1/2, I get the same total area.\n\nSo, average is 240 / 4 = 60.\n\nTherefore, the average area per floor is 60 square feet.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute it manually:\n\nFloor 1: 128\n\nFloor 2: 64\n\nFloor 3: 32\n\nFloor 4: 16\n\nSum: 128 + 64 = 192; 192 + 32 = 224; 224 + 16 = 240.\n\n240 / 4 = 60.\n\nYep, same result.\n\nSo, I think 60 is the correct average area per floor.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe average area per floor is \\boxed{60} square feet.\n</think>\n\nLuc constructs sand castles where each floor has half the area of the floor below it. The top floor has an area of 16 square feet, and there are 4 floors in total.

Starting from the top floor, each subsequent floor below has double the area. Therefore, the areas of the floors from top to bottom are 16, 32, 64, and 128 square feet.\n\nTo find the average area per floor, we calculate the total area of all four floors and then divide by the number of floors.\n\nThe areas of the floors are:\n- Floor 4 (top): 16 square feet\n- Floor 3: 32 square feet\n- Floor 2: 64 square feet\n- Floor 1 (bottom): 128 square feet\n\nThe total area is:\n\\[ 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nThe average area per floor is:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{4} = 60 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nThus, the average area per floor is \\(\\boxed{60}\\) square feet.", "thinking_pred": "Okay, so I have this problem about Luc building sand castles. Each floor has half the area of the one below it. There are 4 floors, and the top floor has an area of 16 square feet. I need to find the average area per floor. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if each floor is half the area of the one below, then the areas form a geometric sequence. A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio. In this case, the common ratio is 1/2 because each floor is half the area of the one below.\n\nBut wait, the top floor is given as 16 square feet, and it's the fourth floor. So, if we think of the floors as going from top to bottom, each subsequent floor is double the area of the one above it. That means the ratio from top to bottom is 2, but from bottom to top, it's 1/2. So, depending on how we index the floors, the common ratio changes.\n\nLet me clarify: If the top floor is 16, the one below it would be 32, then 64, then 128? Wait, no, that can't be. Because if each floor is half the area of the one below, then starting from the top, each floor below would be double the area. So, starting from the top:\n\nFloor 4 (top): 16 sq ft\n\nFloor 3: 16 * 2 = 32 sq ft\n\nFloor 2: 32 * 2 = 64 sq ft\n\nFloor 1 (bottom): 64 * 2 = 128 sq ft\n\nSo, the areas of the floors, from bottom to top, are 128, 64, 32, 16 square feet.\n\nBut I need the average area per floor. So, I can compute the total area of all four floors and then divide by 4.\n\nTotal area = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16\n\nLet me add those up:\n\n128 + 64 = 192\n\n192 + 32 = 224\n\n224 + 16 = 240\n\nSo, total area is 240 square feet.\n\nAverage area per floor = total area / number of floors = 240 / 4 = 60.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a geometric series, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to calculate the total area.\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is:\n\nS_n = a_1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nWhere:\n- S_n is the sum of the first n terms\n- a_1 is the first term\n- r is the common ratio\n- n is the number of terms\n\nBut in this case, I know the last term, not the first term. So, maybe I need to express the sum differently.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the top floor as the first term, then the common ratio is 2, because each term below is double the one above.\n\nSo, if a_1 = 16 (top floor), r = 2, and n = 4.\n\nThen, the sum S_4 = a_1 * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1) = 16 * (2^4 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 16 * (16 - 1) / 1 = 16 * 15 = 240.\n\nSame result as before, so that's reassuring.\n\nSo, total area is 240, average is 240 / 4 = 60.\n\nTherefore, the average area per floor is 60 square feet.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the common ratio. Let me think again.\n\nIf each floor is half the area of the one below, starting from the bottom, then the sequence is 128, 64, 32, 16. So, from bottom to top, each term is multiplied by 1/2.\n\nSo, if I consider the bottom floor as the first term, a_1 = 128, r = 1/2, n = 4.\n\nSum S_4 = a_1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r) = 128 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2) = 128 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2) = 128 * (15/16) / (1/2) = 128 * (15/16) * 2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n128 * (15/16) = (128 / 16) * 15 = 8 * 15 = 120\n\n120 * 2 = 240\n\nAgain, same total area. So, whether I consider the top floor as the first term with ratio 2 or the bottom floor as the first term with ratio 1/2, I get the same total area.\n\nSo, average is 240 / 4 = 60.\n\nTherefore, the average area per floor is 60 square feet.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute it manually:\n\nFloor 1: 128\n\nFloor 2: 64\n\nFloor 3: 32\n\nFloor 4: 16\n\nSum: 128 + 64 = 192; 192 + 32 = 224; 224 + 16 = 240.\n\n240 / 4 = 60.\n\nYep, same result.\n\nSo, I think 60 is the correct average area per floor.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe average area per floor is \\boxed{60} square feet.", "answer_pred": "Luc constructs sand castles where each floor has half the area of the floor below it.

{"idx": 76, "question": "Cécilia vient d'acheter un nouveau chiot. D'après le vétérinaire, elle devra lui donner 1 bol de nourriture pour chien tous les jours pendant les 180 premiers jours. Ensuite, elle devra lui donner 2 bols tous les jours jusqu'à la fin de sa vie. Si un sac de nourriture représente 110 bols, combien de sacs de nourriture pour chiens Cécilia utilisera-t-elle au cours de la première année ?", "answer": "5", "raw_response": "Okay, so Cécilia just bought a new puppy, and she needs to figure out how many bags of dog food she'll use in the first year. The vet told her to feed the puppy 1 bowl every day for the first 180 days, and then switch to 2 bowls a day after that. Each bag has 110 bowls. She wants to know how many bags she'll need in the first year. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the first year has 365 days, right? So, the first 180 days, she's feeding 1 bowl per day. Then, from day 181 to day 365, she'll be feeding 2 bowls each day. So, I need to calculate how many bowls she uses in each of these periods and then add them together to find the total number of bowls in the first year.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal bowls = (Number of days in first period × bowls per day) + (Number of days in second period × bowls per day)\n\nFirst, the first period is 180 days. So, that's 180 days × 1 bowl/day. That's easy, that's 180 bowls.\n\nThen, the second period is from day 181 to day 365. How many days is that? Let's subtract 180 from 365. 365 - 180 is 185 days. So, the second period is 185 days.\n\nIn that time, she's feeding 2 bowls each day. So, 185 days × 2 bowls/day. That would be 370 bowls.\n\nNow, adding both periods together: 180 bowls + 370 bowls = 550 bowls in total for the first year.\n\nEach bag has 110 bowls. So, to find out how many bags she needs, we'll divide the total number of bowls by the number of bowls per bag.\n\nNumber of bags = Total bowls ÷ Bowls per bag\n\nSo, that's 550 ÷ 110. Let me compute that: 550 divided by 110 is 5. So, that would be 5 bags.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the days.\n\nFirst period: 180 days × 1 bowl/day = 180 bowls. That seems correct.\n\nSecond period: 365 - 180 = 185 days. Then, 185 × 2 = 370 bowls. So, 180 + 370 is 550. Divided by 110 is 5. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait another thing, is the first year exactly 365 days? Because sometimes, depending on the date she bought the puppy, it could be a leap year, but I think for this problem, they just want us to consider a standard year, so 365 days is fine.\n\nSo, total bowls per year: 550. Number of bags: 550 ÷ 110 = 5. So, she needs 5 bags.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it another way. If each bag is 110 bowls, how many bowls does she need in the first 180 days? 180 bowls. So, that's 180 ÷ 110. Hmm, that's approximately 1.636 bags. So, she would need 2 bags for the first 180 days because you can't buy a fraction of a bag.\n\nThen, for the next 185 days, she needs 370 bowls. So, 370 ÷ 110 is approximately 3.363 bags. So, she would need 4 bags for the second period.\n\nAdding those together: 2 + 4 = 6 bags. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier answer. Hmm, so which one is correct? Because if she uses 550 bowls in total, 550 ÷ 110 is exactly 5. So, why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, because in the first calculation, I considered the total bowls and divided by the bag size. But in the second approach, I divided each period separately and rounded up each time, which gives a higher number. So, which method is accurate? I think it depends on whether partial bags can be used or not.\n\nIn reality, you can't buy a fraction of a bag, so you need to round up each time. So, if she needs 1.636 bags for the first period, she needs to buy 2 bags. For the second period, 3.363 bags, she needs 4 bags. So, total is 6 bags. But wait, if she uses 550 bowls, and each bag is 110, then 5 bags would give her exactly 550 bowls. So, why the inconsistency?\n\nOh, wait, because when I split it into two periods, we have:\n\nFirst 180 bowls: 180 ÷ 110 = 1.636 bags. So, she needs 2 bags, which gives her 220 bowls.\n\nThen, the next 370 bowls: 370 ÷ 110 = 3.363 bags. So, she needs 4 bags, which gives her 440 bowls.\n\nTotal bowls she actually has: 220 + 440 = 660 bowls. But she only needs 550. So, she's overbuying. So, maybe she can optimize it. But in reality, she can't really buy partial bags, so she might have some leftover.\n\nWait, but is there a smarter way to calculate the number of bags needed without overbuying? Or is the question simply asking for the total number of bowls divided by the bag size, regardless of the partial bags? Because 550 ÷ 110 is exactly 5, so she needs 5 bags. So, maybe the first calculation is correct.\n\nBut hold on, maybe I made a mistake in splitting it into two periods. Let me think about the entire year.\n\nWait, the first 180 days: 1 bowl per day, which is 180 bowls. Then, from day 181 to 365, which is 185 days, 2 bowls per day, so 370 bowls. So, 180 + 370 = 550 bowls. 550 ÷ 110 = 5. So, that's 5 bags.\n\nBut why in my second approach did I get 6? Because I rounded each period separately, which led to overestimating. So, if she can plan her purchases, maybe she can buy 5 bags in total, using exactly 550 bowls. So, perhaps the correct answer is 5 bags.\n\nBut in real life, you can't buy a fraction of a bag, so you would need to round up each time. But maybe in this problem, since 550 is exactly divisible by 110, it comes out to a whole number, which is why 5 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the total bowls weren't a multiple of 110, we would have to round up. For example, if she needed 551 bowls, 551 ÷ 110 is approximately 5.009, so she would need 6 bags.\n\nBut in this case, it's exactly 5. So, maybe the answer is 5 bags. Let me check.\n\nWait, 110 × 5 = 550. So, yes, exactly 5 bags. So, if she can buy exactly 5 bags, that would be sufficient without any leftovers. So, the answer is 5.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think again about the two periods.\n\nFirst 180 days: 1 bowl each day. 180 bowls.\n\nNext 185 days: 2 bowls each day. 370 bowls.\n\nTotal: 550 bowls.\n\nEach bag is 110 bowls. 550 ÷ 110 = 5.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, to make sure, let me compute how many bags are needed for each period.\n\nFirst period: 180 bowls. 180 ÷ 110 = 1.636. So, she needs 2 bags for the first period.\n\nSecond period: 370 ÷ 110 = 3.363. So, she needs 4 bags for the second period.\n\nTotal bags: 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because depending on the approach, it's either 5 or 6 bags.\n\nBut 550 bowls is exactly 5 bags. So, if she can plan her purchases, she can buy 5 bags and have exactly 550 bowls, which is sufficient for the entire year. So, the answer is 5.\n\nBut the other approach, calculating each period separately and rounding up, gives 6 bags, but that would result in 660 bowls, which is more than needed.\n\nSo, which is the correct interpretation?\n\nI think the problem is asking for the total number of bags needed, regardless of whether you can split the usage across bags or not. So, if you can use partial bags, then 5 bags are sufficient. But since you can't buy partial bags, you might need to round up. But in this case, 550 is exactly 5 bags, so 5 is the answer.\n\nWait, but in reality, you can't use partial bags. Each bag is a discrete unit. So, if you need to feed the puppy, you have to have the exact number of bowls. So, if you have 5 bags, that's exactly 550 bowls, which is exactly what she needs. So, she doesn't have any leftover, but she doesn't need any extra. So, 5 bags is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, if the total wasn't a multiple, she would have to round up. For example, if she needed 551 bowls, 5 bags would only give 550, so she would need 6 bags.\n\nBut in this case, since 550 is exactly 5 bags, 5 is sufficient.\n\nSo, the answer is 5.\n\nWait, but in my initial separate calculation, I thought of 2 bags for the first period and 4 bags for the second, totaling 6 bags. But that approach is incorrect because it's assuming that she can't combine the usage across bags for the two periods.\n\nWait, no, actually, she can. She can use the bags across both periods. So, if she buys 5 bags, she can use the first 180 bowls from those 5 bags, and then use the remaining 370 from the same 5 bags. So, in reality, she doesn't need to buy 2 bags for the first period and 4 bags for the second, because she can use the bags across both periods.\n\nSo, the correct way is to add up all the bowls needed for the entire year and then divide by the number of bowls per bag, rounding up if necessary. But in this case, it divides evenly, so 5 bags.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nCécilia utilisera \\boxed{5} sacs de nourriture pour chiens au cours de la première année.\n</think>\n\nCécilia vient d'acheter un nouveau chiot et doit lui donner de la nourriture pendant la première année.

So, she needs 4 bags for the second period.\n\nTotal bags: 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because depending on the approach, it's either 5 or 6 bags.\n\nBut 550 bowls is exactly 5 bags. So, if she can plan her purchases, she can buy 5 bags and have exactly 550 bowls, which is sufficient for the entire year. So, the answer is 5.\n\nBut the other approach, calculating each period separately and rounding up, gives 6 bags, but that would result in 660 bowls, which is more than needed.\n\nSo, which is the correct interpretation?\n\nI think the problem is asking for the total number of bags needed, regardless of whether you can split the usage across bags or not. So, if you can use partial bags, then 5 bags are sufficient. But since you can't buy partial bags, you might need to round up. But in this case, 550 is exactly 5 bags, so 5 is the answer.\n\nWait, but in reality, you can't use partial bags. Each bag is a discrete unit. So, if you need to feed the puppy, you have to have the exact number of bowls. So, if you have 5 bags, that's exactly 550 bowls, which is exactly what she needs. So, she doesn't have any leftover, but she doesn't need any extra. So, 5 bags is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, if the total wasn't a multiple, she would have to round up. For example, if she needed 551 bowls, 5 bags would only give 550, so she would need 6 bags.\n\nBut in this case, since 550 is exactly 5 bags, 5 is sufficient.\n\nSo, the answer is 5.\n\nWait, but in my initial separate calculation, I thought of 2 bags for the first period and 4 bags for the second, totaling 6 bags. But that approach is incorrect because it's assuming that she can't combine the usage across bags for the two periods.\n\nWait, no, actually, she can. She can use the bags across both periods. So, if she buys 5 bags, she can use the first 180 bowls from those 5 bags, and then use the remaining 370 from the same 5 bags. So, in reality, she doesn't need to buy 2 bags for the first period and 4 bags for the second, because she can use the bags across both periods.\n\nSo, the correct way is to add up all the bowls needed for the entire year and then divide by the number of bowls per bag, rounding up if necessary. But in this case, it divides evenly, so 5 bags.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nCécilia utilisera \\boxed{5} sacs de nourriture pour chiens au cours de la première année.", "answer_pred": "Cécilia vient d'acheter un nouveau chiot et doit lui donner de la nourriture pendant la première année.

{"idx": 78, "question": "Vincent a le choix entre acheter des fleurs en paquets de 3 pour 2,50 $ ou en paquets de 2 pour 1 $. Combien d'argent économisera-t-il s'il achète 18 fleurs au meilleur prix ?", "answer": "6", "raw_response": "Okay, so Vincent has a choice between two flower packages: one is a pack of 3 flowers for $2.50, and the other is a pack of 2 flowers for $1.00. He wants to buy 18 flowers, and he wants to spend the least amount of money possible. I need to figure out how much money he can save by choosing the best option. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the cost per flower for each package to see which one is cheaper. That way, I can compare them and see which gives a better deal. \n\nStarting with the first package: 3 flowers for $2.50. To find the cost per flower, I'll divide the total cost by the number of flowers. So, $2.50 divided by 3. Let me calculate that. \n\n2.50 ÷ 3 equals... Hmm, 2.50 divided by 3 is approximately $0.8333 per flower. So, roughly 83 cents per flower.\n\nNow, the second package: 2 flowers for $1.00. Again, I'll divide the total cost by the number of flowers. That's $1.00 divided by 2, which is $0.50 per flower. So, 50 cents per flower.\n\nComparing the two, the second package is cheaper per flower. So, to minimize cost, Vincent should buy as many of the 2-flower packages as possible. But wait, he needs 18 flowers. Let me think about how many packages he needs to buy.\n\nIf he buys the 2-flower packages, each package gives 2 flowers. So, to get 18 flowers, he would need 18 divided by 2, which is 9 packages. Each package costs $1.00, so 9 times $1.00 is $9.00. So, buying all 2-flower packages would cost him $9.00.\n\nAlternatively, if he buys the 3-flower packages, each is $2.50. So, 18 divided by 3 is 6 packages. 6 times $2.50 is $15.00. That's more expensive. So, clearly, the 2-flower packages are a better deal. \n\nBut wait, is there a combination of the two packages that might result in a cheaper total cost? Maybe buying some 3-flower packages and some 2-flower packages could lead to a lower total cost than buying all 2-flower packages. Let me check that.\n\nLet me define variables. Let x be the number of 3-flower packages, and y be the number of 2-flower packages. Then, the total number of flowers is 3x + 2y = 18. The total cost is 2.50x + 1.00y. We need to minimize this cost.\n\nI can set up an equation: 3x + 2y = 18. I want to find integer solutions for x and y (since you can't buy a fraction of a package) that minimize the cost.\n\nLet me express y in terms of x: 2y = 18 - 3x, so y = (18 - 3x)/2. Since y must be an integer, 18 - 3x must be even. Let's see what values of x make 18 - 3x even.\n\nSince 3x is always a multiple of 3, 18 is even, so 18 - 3x is even only when 3x is even, because even minus even is even and even minus odd is odd. But 3x is even only when x is even because 3 times even is even, and 3 times odd is odd. So x must be even.\n\nSo x can be 0, 2, 4, 6. But let's see what y would be.\n\nIf x = 0: y = 18/2 = 9, which gives y = 9. That's the all-2-flower case, total cost is 2.50*0 + 1.00*9 = $9.00.\n\nIf x = 2: 3*2 = 6 flowers, so remaining flowers needed: 18 - 6 = 12. So y = 12/2 = 6. So total cost is 2.50*2 + 1.00*6 = 5.00 + 6.00 = $11.00. That's more expensive than the all-2-flower option.\n\nIf x = 4: 3*4 = 12 flowers, remaining: 18 - 12 = 6. So y = 6/2 = 3. Total cost: 2.50*4 + 1.00*3 = 10.00 + 3.00 = $13.00. Even more expensive.\n\nIf x = 6: 3*6 = 18 flowers, so y = 0. Total cost: 2.50*6 + 1.00*0 = 15.00 + 0.00 = $15.00. That's the all-3-flower case, which was more expensive.\n\nSo, in all these cases, buying more 3-flower packages actually increases the total cost. So, the cheapest is to buy all 2-flower packages for $9.00.\n\nWait, but let me think again—if he buys 3-flower packages, is the cost per flower still higher? Yes, because each 3-flower package is $2.50, which is about 83 cents per flower, which is more expensive than the 50 cents per flower in the 2-flower package. So, indeed, buying as many 2-flower packages as possible is the way to go.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if buying 1 package of 3 and 8 packages of 2 would work. That would be 3 + 16 = 19 flowers, which is one more than needed. But the question is about 18 flowers, so we can't have that. Similarly, buying 5 packages of 3 and 1.5 packages of 2 is not possible since you can't buy half a package.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to get exactly 18 flowers with a combination? Let me see:\n\n18 divided by 3 is 6, so 6 packages of 3. Or, 18 divided by 2 is 9, so 9 packages of 2. Or, is there a mixed combination?\n\nWait, 3x + 2y = 18.\n\nWe already saw that when x is even, y is integer. So, x can be 0, 2, 4, 6.\n\nWe saw that all of these give integer y, but none of them give a lower cost than all 2-flower packages.\n\nTherefore, the minimum cost is $9.00.\n\nBut wait, is there another way? Maybe if he buys some other combination, like 5 packages of 3 and some packages of 2? Let me check:\n\nIf x = 5, then 3*5 = 15 flowers. Remaining flowers: 18 - 15 = 3. But 3 flowers would require 2 packages of 2, which is 4 flowers, but that's too many. Alternatively, 3 flowers would require 1 package of 3, but that's 3 flowers. So, 5 packages of 3 and 1 package of 3? That's 6 packages of 3, which is 18 flowers, same as before, costing $15.00.\n\nAlternatively, if he buys 4 packages of 3, which is 12 flowers, then he needs 6 more flowers, which would be 3 packages of 2, costing $3.00. So total cost is $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00, which is more than $9.00.\n\nWait, so no combination gives a better price than all 2-flower packages. Therefore, the cheapest is $9.00.\n\nBut let me think again—if 3-flower packages are $2.50, which is more than 2-flower packages per flower, but maybe for some number of flowers, buying a 3-flower might give a better deal? Wait, 2.50 for 3 is about 0.83 per flower, which is more expensive than 0.50 per flower for 2. So, no, 2-flower is cheaper.\n\nTherefore, to buy 18 flowers, the cheapest way is to buy 9 packages of 2 flowers, costing $9.00.\n\nWait, but let me think—could he buy 8 packages of 2, which is 16 flowers, and then 1 package of 3 for the remaining 2 flowers? Wait, 16 + 3 = 19 flowers, which is more than 18. So, that's not possible. Alternatively, 7 packages of 2 is 14 flowers, and 2 packages of 3 is 6 flowers, totaling 20 flowers. That's too much. So, no, he can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 4 packages of 3 (12 flowers) and 3 packages of 2 (6 flowers). That's 18 flowers, total cost is 4*2.50 + 3*1.00 = 10.00 + 3.00 = $13.00, which is more expensive than $9.00.\n\nTherefore, the minimal cost is $9.00.\n\nBut wait, let's compute the price per flower again. 2.50 for 3 is about 0.8333, and 1.00 for 2 is 0.50. So, 0.50 is cheaper. So, buying 2s is better.\n\nWait, but maybe if he buys 2 packages of 3 and 6 packages of 2, total flowers would be 6 + 12 = 18. Cost: 2*2.50 + 6*1.00 = 5.00 + 6.00 = $11.00, which is more than $9.00.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that buying all 2-flower packages is cheaper.\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount he has to spend is $9.00. So, how much does he save compared to buying all 3-flower packages?\n\nIf he buys all 3-flower packages, he spends $15.00. If he buys all 2-flower packages, he spends $9.00. So, the amount saved is $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00. So, he saves $6.00.\n\nBut wait, the question is: \"Combien d'argent économisera-t-il s'il achète 18 fleurs au meilleur prix ?\" So, it's asking how much money he will save by buying 18 flowers at the best price. So, I think the way to interpret this is: he is comparing buying all 3-flower packages versus buying all 2-flower packages. So, the saving is the difference between the two totals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking how much he saves compared to buying individual flowers at the higher price? Wait, no, the two options are the only ones given: either buy 3 for $2.50 or 2 for $1.00. So, the best price is buying all 2s, which costs $9.00, and the alternative is buying all 3s, which costs $15.00. So, the saving is $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.\n\nBut let me make sure. The question is: \"Combien d'argent économisera-t-il s'il achète 18 fleurs au meilleur prix ?\" So, \"How much money will he save if he buys 18 flowers at the best price?\" So, it's comparing buying 18 flowers at the best price versus buying them otherwise. But in the problem, the only two options are the two packages. So, the best price is $9.00, and the alternative is $15.00, so he saves $6.00.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking how much he saves compared to buying individual flowers without any package deal. But the problem only mentions two options: the 3-for-2.50 and the 2-for-1.00. So, I think the saving is relative to the other package option. So, if he chooses the cheaper package, he saves $6.00 compared to choosing the more expensive package.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $6.00.\n\nBut just to double-check: 18 flowers bought at the best price is $9.00. If he were to buy them at the other package, he would pay $15.00. So, the saving is $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nVincent économisera \\boxed{6} dollars.\n</think>\n\nVincent has a choice between two flower packages: a pack of 3 flowers for $2.50 and a pack of 2 flowers for $1.00.

Let's see what values of x make 18 - 3x even.\n\nSince 3x is always a multiple of 3, 18 is even, so 18 - 3x is even only when 3x is even, because even minus even is even and even minus odd is odd. But 3x is even only when x is even because 3 times even is even, and 3 times odd is odd. So x must be even.\n\nSo x can be 0, 2, 4, 6. But let's see what y would be.\n\nIf x = 0: y = 18/2 = 9, which gives y = 9. That's the all-2-flower case, total cost is 2.50*0 + 1.00*9 = $9.00.\n\nIf x = 2: 3*2 = 6 flowers, so remaining flowers needed: 18 - 6 = 12. So y = 12/2 = 6. So total cost is 2.50*2 + 1.00*6 = 5.00 + 6.00 = $11.00. That's more expensive than the all-2-flower option.\n\nIf x = 4: 3*4 = 12 flowers, remaining: 18 - 12 = 6. So y = 6/2 = 3. Total cost: 2.50*4 + 1.00*3 = 10.00 + 3.00 = $13.00. Even more expensive.\n\nIf x = 6: 3*6 = 18 flowers, so y = 0. Total cost: 2.50*6 + 1.00*0 = 15.00 + 0.00 = $15.00. That's the all-3-flower case, which was more expensive.\n\nSo, in all these cases, buying more 3-flower packages actually increases the total cost. So, the cheapest is to buy all 2-flower packages for $9.00.\n\nWait, but let me think again—if he buys 3-flower packages, is the cost per flower still higher? Yes, because each 3-flower package is $2.50, which is about 83 cents per flower, which is more expensive than the 50 cents per flower in the 2-flower package. So, indeed, buying as many 2-flower packages as possible is the way to go.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if buying 1 package of 3 and 8 packages of 2 would work. That would be 3 + 16 = 19 flowers, which is one more than needed. But the question is about 18 flowers, so we can't have that. Similarly, buying 5 packages of 3 and 1.5 packages of 2 is not possible since you can't buy half a package.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to get exactly 18 flowers with a combination? Let me see:\n\n18 divided by 3 is 6, so 6 packages of 3. Or, 18 divided by 2 is 9, so 9 packages of 2. Or, is there a mixed combination?\n\nWait, 3x + 2y = 18.\n\nWe already saw that when x is even, y is integer. So, x can be 0, 2, 4, 6.\n\nWe saw that all of these give integer y, but none of them give a lower cost than all 2-flower packages.\n\nTherefore, the minimum cost is $9.00.\n\nBut wait, is there another way? Maybe if he buys some other combination, like 5 packages of 3 and some packages of 2? Let me check:\n\nIf x = 5, then 3*5 = 15 flowers. Remaining flowers: 18 - 15 = 3. But 3 flowers would require 2 packages of 2, which is 4 flowers, but that's too many. Alternatively, 3 flowers would require 1 package of 3, but that's 3 flowers. So, 5 packages of 3 and 1 package of 3? That's 6 packages of 3, which is 18 flowers, same as before, costing $15.00.\n\nAlternatively, if he buys 4 packages of 3, which is 12 flowers, then he needs 6 more flowers, which would be 3 packages of 2, costing $3.00. So total cost is $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00, which is more than $9.00.\n\nWait, so no combination gives a better price than all 2-flower packages. Therefore, the cheapest is $9.00.\n\nBut let me think again—if 3-flower packages are $2.50, which is more than 2-flower packages per flower, but maybe for some number of flowers, buying a 3-flower might give a better deal? Wait, 2.50 for 3 is about 0.83 per flower, which is more expensive than 0.50 per flower for 2. So, no, 2-flower is cheaper.\n\nTherefore, to buy 18 flowers, the cheapest way is to buy 9 packages of 2 flowers, costing $9.00.\n\nWait, but let me think—could he buy 8 packages of 2, which is 16 flowers, and then 1 package of 3 for the remaining 2 flowers? Wait, 16 + 3 = 19 flowers, which is more than 18. So, that's not possible. Alternatively, 7 packages of 2 is 14 flowers, and 2 packages of 3 is 6 flowers, totaling 20 flowers. That's too much. So, no, he can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 4 packages of 3 (12 flowers) and 3 packages of 2 (6 flowers). That's 18 flowers, total cost is 4*2.50 + 3*1.00 = 10.00 + 3.00 = $13.00, which is more expensive than $9.00.\n\nTherefore, the minimal cost is $9.00.\n\nBut wait, let's compute the price per flower again. 2.50 for 3 is about 0.8333, and 1.00 for 2 is 0.50. So, 0.50 is cheaper. So, buying 2s is better.\n\nWait, but maybe if he buys 2 packages of 3 and 6 packages of 2, total flowers would be 6 + 12 = 18. Cost: 2*2.50 + 6*1.00 = 5.00 + 6.00 = $11.00, which is more than $9.00.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that buying all 2-flower packages is cheaper.\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount he has to spend is $9.00. So, how much does he save compared to buying all 3-flower packages?\n\nIf he buys all 3-flower packages, he spends $15.00. If he buys all 2-flower packages, he spends $9.00. So, the amount saved is $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00. So, he saves $6.00.\n\nBut wait, the question is: \"Combien d'argent économisera-t-il s'il achète 18 fleurs au meilleur prix ?\" So, it's asking how much money he will save by buying 18 flowers at the best price. So, I think the way to interpret this is: he is comparing buying all 3-flower packages versus buying all 2-flower packages. So, the saving is the difference between the two totals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking how much he saves compared to buying individual flowers at the higher price? Wait, no, the two options are the only ones given: either buy 3 for $2.50 or 2 for $1.00. So, the best price is buying all 2s, which costs $9.00, and the alternative is buying all 3s, which costs $15.00. So, the saving is $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.\n\nBut let me make sure. The question is: \"Combien d'argent économisera-t-il s'il achète 18 fleurs au meilleur prix ?\" So, \"How much money will he save if he buys 18 flowers at the best price?\" So, it's comparing buying 18 flowers at the best price versus buying them otherwise. But in the problem, the only two options are the two packages. So, the best price is $9.00, and the alternative is $15.00, so he saves $6.00.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking how much he saves compared to buying individual flowers without any package deal. But the problem only mentions two options: the 3-for-2.50 and the 2-for-1.00. So, I think the saving is relative to the other package option. So, if he chooses the cheaper package, he saves $6.00 compared to choosing the more expensive package.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $6.00.\n\nBut just to double-check: 18 flowers bought at the best price is $9.00. If he were to buy them at the other package, he would pay $15.00. So, the saving is $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nVincent économisera \\boxed{6} dollars.", "answer_pred": "Vincent has a choice between two flower packages: a pack of 3 flowers for $2.50 and a pack of 2 flowers for $1.00.

{"idx": 80, "question": "Deux filles ont reçu chacune 1/6 des 24 litres d'eau. Un garçon a ensuite reçu 6 litres d'eau. Combien de litres d'eau reste-t-il ?", "answer": "10", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to figure out how much water is left after distributing it among the two girls and the boy. So, the problem says that two girls each received 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. Then a boy got 6 liters. I need to find out how much water remains.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how much water each girl received. Since each girl got 1/6 of 24 liters, I can compute that by multiplying 24 by 1/6. Let me write that down:\n\n24 liters * (1/6) = ?\n\nHmm, 24 divided by 6 is 4. So each girl received 4 liters. That makes sense because 1/6 of 24 is 4. So, each girl has 4 liters.\n\nNow, since there are two girls, I need to find the total amount of water they both received together. That would be 4 liters per girl times 2 girls. So, 4 * 2 = 8 liters. So, the two girls together received 8 liters.\n\nNext, the boy received 6 liters. So, I need to add that to the amount the girls took. So, total water distributed is the girls' 8 liters plus the boy's 6 liters.\n\n8 liters + 6 liters = 14 liters. So, 14 liters have been given out in total.\n\nNow, the original amount was 24 liters. To find out how much is left, I subtract the total distributed from the original amount.\n\n24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 24 minus 14 is indeed 10. So, there should be 10 liters of water remaining.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again. Each girl gets 1/6 of 24, which is 4 liters each. Two girls would take 8 liters. The boy takes 6 liters. So total given out is 14 liters. Subtracting from 24 gives 10 liters left. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think another way to look at it is to compute the fractions first. So, two girls each getting 1/6 would be 2*(1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3. So, 1/3 of 24 liters is 8 liters. Then the boy takes 6 liters. So, 8 + 6 = 14. 24 - 14 is 10. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of how much water hasn't been given out. After giving to the two girls and the boy, the remaining water is what's left. So, 24 - (4 + 4 + 6) = 24 - 14 = 10. So, 10 liters.\n\nI guess another way to check is to think of the fractions. 1/6 each for the girls, so that's 2/6 or 1/3. The boy got 6 liters, which is what fraction of the total? 6 is 6/24, which simplifies to 1/4. So, total fractions given out are 1/3 + 1/4. Let me compute that.\n\n1/3 is approximately 0.3333, and 1/4 is 0.25. Adding them together gives 0.5833, which is 7/12. So, 7/12 of the water has been given out. 7/12 of 24 is (7*24)/12 = 168/12 = 14 liters. So, the total distributed is 14 liters, meaning 24 - 14 = 10 liters are left.

That part is straightforward. Now, Alex's weight is described as 2 pounds less than four times Grace's weight. Hmm, so I need to calculate four times Grace's weight first and then subtract 2 pounds from that.\n\nLet me write this out mathematically. If Grace's weight is 125 pounds, then four times her weight would be 4 multiplied by 125. So, 4 * 125. Let me calculate that. 125 times 4, let's see: 100 times 4 is 400, and 25 times 4 is 100, so 400 + 100 is 500. So, four times Grace's weight is 500 pounds.\n\nBut Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that. So, I need to subtract 2 pounds from 500 pounds. That would be 500 - 2, which is 498 pounds. So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.\n\nNow, to find the total weight of both Grace and Alex, I need to add their weights together. Grace is 125 pounds and Alex is 498 pounds. So, 125 + 498. Let me add those numbers. 125 plus 400 is 525, and then adding 98 more would be 525 + 98.\n\nWait, let me do that addition more carefully. 525 + 98: 525 + 90 is 615, and then +8 is 623. So, the total combined weight is 623 pounds.\n\nHold on, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Grace's weight: 125 pounds. Four times that is 4 * 125, which is 500. Then, Alex's weight is 500 - 2, which is indeed 498. Then, adding Grace's 125, so 125 + 498. Let me add 125 + 498.\n\nAnother way to add these is to break it down. 125 + 498 can be thought of as (100 + 25) + (400 + 98). So, adding the hundreds: 100 + 400 is 500. Then, the tens: 25 + 98. 25 + 98 is 123. So, 500 + 123 is 623. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use column addition:\n\n```\n 125\n+498\n------\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit: 5 + 8 is 13. Write down 3 and carry over 1. Next, the middle digits: 2 + 9 is 11, plus the carried over 1 makes 12. Write down 2 and carry over 1. Then, the leftmost digits: 1 + 4 is 5, plus the carried over 1 is 6. So, the total is 623. That checks out.\n\nSo, all my calculations lead me to the conclusion that the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds. I don't think I made any mistakes here since both methods of addition gave me the same result.

{"idx": 83, "question": "Dan plante 3 rosiers. Chaque rosier compte 25 roses et chaque rose 8 épines. Combien d'épines y a-t-il en tout ?", "answer": "600", "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Dan planted 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses, and each rose has 8 thorns. I need to figure out the total number of thorns. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given. Dan has 3 rose bushes. Each of these bushes has 25 roses. So, the total number of roses is probably 3 multiplied by 25. Let me write that down: 3 bushes * 25 roses per bush. Calculating that, 3 times 25 is 75. So, there are 75 roses in total.\n\nNow, each rose has 8 thorns. So, if I want to find out the total number of thorns, I need to multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose. That would be 75 roses * 8 thorns per rose. Let me compute that. 75 multiplied by 8... Hmm, 70 times 8 is 560, and 5 times 8 is 40, so adding those together gives 600. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check: 75 * 8. 75 times 10 is 750, subtract 75 * 2 which is 150, so 750 - 150 is 600. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 3 bushes * 25 roses = 75 roses. Then, 75 roses * 8 thorns = 600 thorns. Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me visualize it. Imagine each rose bush has 25 roses. So, if I have 3 bushes, that's like 25, 25, and 25. Adding those together, it's 75. Each of those 75 roses has 8 thorns. So, each rose contributes 8 thorns. Therefore, 75 times 8. Hmm, 75 is three quarters of 100, and three quarters of 800 would be 600, so that lines up. Yeah, I think that's right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as multiplying 3 by 25 first, which gives 75. Then, 75 multiplied by 8. Since multiplication is commutative, I can rearrange it if it helps. Maybe 8 * 75 is easier. Let's see: 8 * 70 is 560, and 8 * 5 is 40. 560 + 40 is 600. Yep, same result.\n\nI guess another way to approach it is to use the distributive property. Let's see: 3 * 25 * 8. I can rearrange the multiplication as (3 * 8) * 25. 3 times 8 is 24, and then 24 times 25. Hmm, 24 * 25. I know that 25 times 4 is 100, so 24 is 6 times 4. So, 25 * 24 is 25 * (6 * 4) = (25 * 4) * 6 = 100 * 6 = 600. Cool, that still gets me 600.\n\nJust to ensure I haven't overlooked anything, let me re-read the problem. \"Dan plante 3 rosiers. Chaque rosier compte 25 roses et chaque rose 8 épines. Combien d'épines y a-t-il en tout ?\" Translating that, it's all correct: 3 rose bushes, each with 25 roses, each rose with 8 thorns. So, the math seems to fit. I don't think I misread anything.\n\nIs there another angle to check? Maybe by considering if the thorns per rose are 8, so per bush, how many thorns are there? Let's see: 25 roses per bush, each with 8 thorns, so 25 * 8 = 200 thorns per bush. Then, 3 bushes would be 200 * 3 = 600. Oh, that's another way to compute it, and it still gives 600. So, that confirms it again.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple ways: computing total roses first, then thorns; computing thorns per bush first, then total thorns. Both approaches lead me to 600. So, I feel confident that 600 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap: 3 bushes * 25 roses = 75 roses. 75 roses * 8 thorns = 600 thorns. Yep, that's solid.\n\nI wonder if there's any chance I could have made a multiplication error. Let me compute 75 * 8 again. 75 times 8: 70*8=560, 5*8=40, so 560+40=600. Correct. Alternatively, 8*75: 8*70=560, 8*5=40, 560+40=600. Same result.\n\nAlternatively, 75*8 can be thought of as 75*10 minus 75*2. 75*10=750, 75*2=150, so 750-150=600. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible angles to confirm that 600 is the right answer.

{"idx": 84, "question": "Une équipe de football a joué 22 matchs. Elle a gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu. Combien de fois a-t-elle gagné ?", "answer": "15", "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a football team that played 22 matches. It says they won _ times more than they lost. Hmm, I need to figure out how many times they won. Wait, the blank is probably supposed to be filled in with a number, but it's missing here. Hmm, maybe I should think about how to approach it regardless of the number.\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. There's a football team that has played 22 matches in total. The number of matches they won is some multiple of the number of matches they lost. So, if I let the number of losses be, say, L, then the number of wins would be something like k times L, where k is the multiple. But the problem doesn't specify what k is, so maybe I need to figure that out too?\n\nWait, no, hold on. The original problem says \"elle a gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu.\" So, in French, that translates to \"she won _ times more than she lost.\" So, it's a fill-in-the-blank question, but the blank is empty. Hmm, maybe it's a typo or something missing. But since I don't have the number, maybe I can approach it algebraically.\n\nAlright, let's set up some variables. Let’s say the number of losses is L. Then the number of wins would be k times that, so W = k * L. The total number of matches is 22, so W + L = 22. Substituting the first equation into the second, we get k*L + L = 22. That simplifies to L*(k + 1) = 22. Therefore, L = 22 / (k + 1). Since the number of losses has to be a whole number, 22 must be divisible by (k + 1). So, (k + 1) has to be a factor of 22.\n\nWait, but without knowing k, I can't find L or W. Hmm, maybe the problem actually did have a number in the blank, but it's missing here. Let me check again. The original problem says: \"Une équipe de football a joué 22 matchs. Elle a gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu. Combien de fois a-t-elle gagné ?\"\n\nYes, it's blank. Hmmm. Maybe I can think of this as a general problem, where if the number of wins is k times the number of losses, then we can find possible values of k such that 22 is divisible by (k + 1). So, factors of 22 are 1, 2, 11, 22.\n\nSo, k + 1 can be 1, 2, 11, or 22. Therefore, k can be 0, 1, 10, or 21.\n\nBut k=0 would mean they didn't win any matches, which doesn't make sense because they can't have negative wins. So, k=1: They won 1 times more than they lost. So, W = L. Then W + L =22, so 2W =22, so W=11. But \"1 times more\" is a bit confusing because if they lost L matches, winning 1 times more would mean W = L + L = 2L? Wait, maybe I need to clarify the wording.\n\nIn French, \"gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu\" can be ambiguous. Does it mean they won k times as many as they lost, or k times more than they lost? In English, \"k times more than\" often means k+1 times as many. So, for example, \"2 times more\" means 3 times as many. So, if they won k times more than they lost, that would mean W = (k + 1)*L.\n\nWait, so in that case, if \"k times plus\" is used, it's sometimes interpreted as \"k times as many,\" but sometimes as \"k times more,\" which could be additive. Hmm, I think in French, \"fois plus\" usually means multiplicative. So, \"k fois plus\" means k times as much. So, if they won k times more than they lost, that is W = k*L.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use \"k fois plus\" to mean they have k times more, which would be W = L + k*L = (k+1)*L. So, I need to clarify which interpretation is correct.\n\nIn the original problem, if it's \"gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" it's ambiguous. Hmm. But in mathematics, usually, \"k times more than\" is taken as k times as much, not k times plus the original. So, W = k*L, not W = (k+1)*L. So, I think it's safer to take it as multiplicative.\n\nTherefore, if W = k*L, then W + L =22, so k*L + L =22, so L*(k +1)=22. So, same as before. So, L=22/(k +1). Therefore, k +1 must be a divisor of 22. So, k +1 can be 1,2,11,22. So, k can be 0,1,10,21. But, as before, k=0 would mean they didn't win any matches, which is possible, but the wording suggests that they did win some.\n\nSo, k=1: W =1*L, so total matches: 2*L=22, so L=11, W=11. So, 11 wins and 11 losses. Is that possible? Yeah, they could have a 11-11 record.\n\nk=10: Then, W=10*L, so total matches:10*L + L=11*L=22, so L=2, W=20. So, 20 wins and 2 losses.\n\nk=21: W=21*L, so total matches:21*L + L=22*L=22, so L=1, W=21. So, 21 wins and 1 loss.\n\nBut since the problem is asking \"Combien de fois a-t-elle gagné ?\" which is \"How many times has she won?\" without specifying, but the original problem has a blank in the French, perhaps the k was supposed to be given? Maybe the user made a typo and the problem was supposed to have a number in the blank.\n\nWait, looking back, the original problem is: \"Une équipe de football a joué 22 matchs. Elle a gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu. Combien de fois a-t-elle gagné ?\"\n\nSo, it's definitely a fill-in-the-blank, but the blank is empty. So, perhaps in the original source, there was a number there, but it's missing here. So, without knowing the value of k, I can't give a specific number of wins. But maybe it's expecting me to set up the equation.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider that in the context of the problem, the number of wins is an integer, so k must be such that 22/(k +1) is integer, so possible k values: 0,1,10,21. So, possible numbers of wins: 11,20,21.\n\nBut without knowing k, I can't choose. So, maybe the original problem had a number in the blank, like \"gagné 2 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu.\" If that's the case, then k=2, so W=2*L.\n\nThen, W + L=22, so 2*L + L=3*L=22. Wait, but 22 divided by 3 is not an integer. So, that can't be. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the user just forgot to include the number, but in the problem statement, maybe it's \"gagné 2 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" so k=2. Then, 3*L=22, which is not integer. So, maybe k=3: 4*L=22, which is 5.5, not integer. k=4:5*L=22, 4.4, still not integer. k=5:6*L=22, 3.666... Not integer. k=10:11*L=22, so L=2, which is integer.\n\nWait, so if k=10, then L=2, W=20. So, maybe the original problem had k=10, making 20 wins.\n\nAlternatively, if k=1: W=11, L=11. If k=21: W=21, L=1.\n\nBut without knowing k, I can't know. So, maybe the problem expects me to set up the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem was supposed to say \"gagné 3 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" making W=3*L, so 4*L=22, but 22 isn't divisible by 4, so that's not possible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different number of total matches? But no, it's 22.\n\nWait, perhaps the user had a different number in mind, but it's not here. So, maybe I can think about possible k values that would give integer solutions.\n\nSo, as before, k +1 must be a divisor of 22. So, possible k +1:1,2,11,22. So, k can be 0,1,10,21.\n\nThus, possible number of wins: If k=0: W=0, which is unlikely because the team played 22 matches, so at least they have some wins or losses. But if k=0, they didn't win any, so all 22 are losses. But then, they didn't win any, which is possible, but the problem states \"combien de fois a-t-elle gagné,\" implying they did win some.\n\nSo, k=1: W=11, L=11.\n\nk=10: W=20, L=2.\n\nk=21: W=21, L=1.\n\nSo, these are the possible solutions.\n\nBut since the problem is presented as a fill-in-the-blank with \"gagné _ fois plus,\" but the blank is empty here, perhaps the original problem had a specific k, but it's missing. So, without that, I can't find a specific answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the problem statement, the blank was supposed to be replaced by a number that's not visible here, but in the user's original context, it was filled in. Since I don't have that, maybe I should explain the process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to provide the number but it didn't come through. So, perhaps I can ask for clarification, but since this is a monologue, I can't. So, I have to make an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blank is supposed to be \"2 fois plus,\" so k=2, but as I saw earlier, that would require 3*L=22, which is not integer. So, maybe the problem is wrong or the number is missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the team didn't have any draws, so all matches resulted in wins or losses. So, W + L=22. If W = k*L, then L=22/(k +1). So, depending on k, you get different results.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem had a different number in the blank, and it's a misprint here. Since the user is asking for the number of wins, maybe I can think of a possible k that would make sense.\n\nWait, 22 divided by (k +1) must be integer, so k +1 must be a factor of 22, which is 1,2,11,22. So, k=0,1,10,21.\n\nSo, the possible number of wins are 11,20,21.\n\nSo, unless the problem specifies a particular k, I can't know. So, perhaps the user intended to put a specific number in the blank, but it didn't come through. So, perhaps they can edit the problem to include that.\n\nBut since I have to provide an answer, maybe I can see if the user expects a particular number. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user wrote \"gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu.\" So, the blank is there, but it's empty. Maybe in the original context, the user had a number, but it's missing here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a translation issue. Maybe the user meant to write a number but it's not showing. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants me to express the answer in terms of k, but the problem is asking for a specific number.\n\nWait, maybe I can think that in the original problem, the number was 2, so k=2, but as we saw, that leads to non-integer. So, perhaps 3, but same problem. Maybe 1, which gives 11 wins. So, maybe 11.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is in French, the user might have written the number in French, like \"deux fois plus,\" but it's blank here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user just wants me to explain the process, but they said to put the final answer in a box, so maybe they expect a numerical answer.\n\nWait, given that, maybe I can think about the most straightforward answer, which is if k=1, so W=11, L=11. So, 11 wins.\n\nAlternatively, if k=10, then 20 wins and 2 losses, which is a very successful team, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, k=21, 21 wins and 1 loss, almost a perfect season.\n\nBut without knowing k, it's impossible to know for sure. So, perhaps in the original problem, k was given, but it didn't come through. So, maybe the answer is 11, assuming k=1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different total number of matches, but it's 22 here.\n\nWait, if I think about the common problems like this, usually the multiple is 2, but as we saw, 22 isn't divisible by 3. So, maybe the multiple is 1, giving 11 wins and 11 losses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 10 times more, giving 20 wins and 2 losses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the wording, maybe it's \"gagné _ fois qu'elle n'a perdu,\" without the \"plus,\" which would mean \"k times as many as they lost,\" so W =k*L. So, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, the user might have meant that the number of wins is k times the number of losses plus something else. Hmm, but the wording is \"gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" which is \"won _ times more than they lost.\"\n\nIn any case, without knowing the specific multiple, I can’t give an exact number. So, perhaps I can conclude that the possible number of wins are 11,20, or 21, depending on the value of k, which is missing here.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had a different total number of matches, but it's 22. Hmm.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is \"gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" meaning that the number of wins is equal to the number of losses plus some multiple. Hmm, no, that's not how it's phrased.\n\nAlternatively, \"gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu\" could be interpreted as W = L + k*L, which is W = (k +1)*L. So, that would mean k times more, in addition to the original L.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then W = (k +1)*L, so W + L =22, so (k +1)*L + L= (k +2)*L=22. So, L=22/(k +2). So, (k +2) must divide 22. Therefore, k +2 can be 1,2,11,22. So, k can be -1,0,9,20.\n\nBut k can't be negative because you can't have negative times more. So, k=0,9,20.\n\nk=0: W = L, so 2*L=22, L=11, W=11.\n\nk=9: W=11*L, so 12*L=22, L=22/12≈1.833, not integer.\n\nk=20: W=22*L, so 23*L=22, L≈0.956, not integer.\n\nSo, only possible is k=0, leading to W=11, L=11.\n\nHmm, so depending on the interpretation of \"k fois plus,\" the answer could be either 11,20,21 or 11. So, if interpreted as multiplicative (W=k*L), then possible W=11,20,21. If interpreted as additive (W=L +k*L=(k +1)*L), then only possible W=11.\n\nSo, in the second interpretation, only 11 is possible, because the others lead to fractional losses. So, maybe the correct interpretation is that W is k times more than L, meaning W = (k +1)*L, so only k=0 is possible, giving 11 wins.\n\nBut the problem says \"gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" which would translate more naturally to \"won _ times more than they lost,\" which is usually interpreted as multiplicative. So, W =k*L.\n\nBut in that case, unless k +1 divides 22, you don't get integer solutions. So, since 22 is 2*11, the factors are limited.\n\nSo, if I have to choose, maybe the intended answer is 11, with k=1, so 11 wins and 11 losses.\n\nAlternatively, if it's meant to be 10 times more, so k=10, leading to 20 wins and 2 losses.\n\nBut without knowing, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the original problem had \"gagné deux fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" meaning k=2, which would mean W=2*L. Then, total matches: 2*L + L=3*L=22, which isn't integer. So, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, \"gagné trois fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" so k=3: 4*L=22, which is 5.5, not integer.\n\nHmm, perhaps the original problem had k=1, so W=11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of matches is different, but in the problem, it's 22.\n\nWait, unless the team can have draws, but the problem doesn't mention draws, so it's safe to assume all matches resulted in wins or losses.\n\nSo, in conclusion, without knowing the specific multiple, I can't give an exact number. But based on the factors of 22, the possible number of wins are 11,20, or 21. So, if I had to pick one, maybe 11 is the most straightforward, assuming k=1. So, the team won 11 matches.\n\nBut just to be thorough, if k=10, W=20, L=2, which is also possible. Similarly, if k=21, W=21, L=1.\n\nSo, unless more information is given, all three are possible. Since the problem is presented as a fill-in-the-blank with a missing number, maybe the original problem had k=10, leading to 20 wins. But without knowing, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it, 22 is a small number, so 21 wins and 1 loss is possible, but that's a very high number. 20 wins and 2 losses is also high. 11 wins and 11 losses is a balanced record.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is 11, as it's the most balanced and the simplest.\n\nBut honestly, without the specific multiple, I can't be sure. Maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the number of wins is equal to the number of losses plus some multiple, but without the number, it's unclear.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the blank is supposed to be filled with \"1,\" making it \"gagné 1 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" which would mean they won 1 more match than they lost. So, W = L +1. Then, W + L=22, so L +1 + L=22, so 2L +1=22, so 2L=21, which is not integer. So, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, \"gagné 2 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" meaning W=2*L. Then, 2*L + L=3*L=22, which isn't integer.\n\nWait, maybe it's \"gagné 3 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" so W=3*L, 4*L=22, which is 5.5, not integer.\n\nWait, maybe it's \"gagné 10 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" so W=10*L, 11*L=22, L=2, so W=20.\n\nSo, maybe 20 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, \"gagné 21 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" so W=21*L, 22*L=22, L=1, W=21.\n\nSo, depending on the number, it's 20 or 21.\n\nBut since 20 is more reasonable than 21, maybe 20.\n\nBut I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, if it's \"gagné 1 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" meaning W=1*L, so 2*L=22, so L=11, W=11. So, 11 is the answer.\n\nWait, but in French, \"gagné une fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu\" would mean W=L, so same number of wins and losses. So, 11 each.\n\nAlternatively, \"gagné deux fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" would mean W=2*L, but as we saw, that leads to non-integer. So, maybe 11 is the intended answer.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most probable answer is 11, assuming the blank was filled with \"1 fois plus,\" leading to 11 wins and 11 losses.\n\nBut, to be safe, I can note that depending on the missing number, the answer could be 11,20, or21.\n\nBut since the problem is presented as a fill-in-the-blank, and the user is asking for the number of wins, I think they expect a specific answer, probably 11.\n\nSo, I'll go with 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe team won \\boxed{11} matches.\n</think>\n\nLet’s denote the number of losses as \\( L \\) and the number of wins as \\( W \\). The problem states that the team played 22 matches in total, so we have:\n\n\\[ W + L = 22 \\]\n\nIt also states that the team won \\( k \\) times more than they lost. This can be interpreted as \\( W = k \\times L \\). Substituting this into the total matches equation, we get:\n\n\\[ k \\times L + L = 22 \\]\n\\[ L \\times (k + 1) = 22 \\]\n\nThus, \\( L \\) must be a divisor of 22. The factors of 22 are 1, 2, 11, and 22. Therefore, \\( k + 1 \\) must be one of these factors, leading to possible values of \\( k \\) as 0, 1, 10, or 21.\n\n- If \\( k = 0 \\), then \\( L = 22 \\) and \\( W = 0 \\). This is unlikely as the team must have won some matches.\n- If \\( k = 1 \\), then \\( L = 11 \\) and \\( W = 11 \\).\n- If \\( k = 10 \\), then \\( L = 2 \\) and \\( W = 20 \\).\n- If \\( k = 21 \\), then \\( L = 1 \\) and \\( W = 21 \\).\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the problem and the need for a specific answer, the most straightforward and balanced solution is when \\( k = 1 \\), leading to 11 wins and 11 losses.\n\nThus, the team won \\boxed{11} matches.", "thinking_pred": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a football team that played 22 matches. It says they won _ times more than they lost. Hmm, I need to figure out how many times they won. Wait, the blank is probably supposed to be filled in with a number, but it's missing here. Hmm, maybe I should think about how to approach it regardless of the number.\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. There's a football team that has played 22 matches in total. The number of matches they won is some multiple of the number of matches they lost. So, if I let the number of losses be, say, L, then the number of wins would be something like k times L, where k is the multiple. But the problem doesn't specify what k is, so maybe I need to figure that out too?\n\nWait, no, hold on. The original problem says \"elle a gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu.\" So, in French, that translates to \"she won _ times more than she lost.\" So, it's a fill-in-the-blank question, but the blank is empty. Hmm, maybe it's a typo or something missing. But since I don't have the number, maybe I can approach it algebraically.\n\nAlright, let's set up some variables. Let’s say the number of losses is L. Then the number of wins would be k times that, so W = k * L. The total number of matches is 22, so W + L = 22. Substituting the first equation into the second, we get k*L + L = 22. That simplifies to L*(k + 1) = 22. Therefore, L = 22 / (k + 1). Since the number of losses has to be a whole number, 22 must be divisible by (k + 1). So, (k + 1) has to be a factor of 22.\n\nWait, but without knowing k, I can't find L or W. Hmm, maybe the problem actually did have a number in the blank, but it's missing here. Let me check again. The original problem says: \"Une équipe de football a joué 22 matchs. Elle a gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu. Combien de fois a-t-elle gagné ?\"\n\nYes, it's blank. Hmmm. Maybe I can think of this as a general problem, where if the number of wins is k times the number of losses, then we can find possible values of k such that 22 is divisible by (k + 1). So, factors of 22 are 1, 2, 11, 22.\n\nSo, k + 1 can be 1, 2, 11, or 22. Therefore, k can be 0, 1, 10, or 21.\n\nBut k=0 would mean they didn't win any matches, which doesn't make sense because they can't have negative wins. So, k=1: They won 1 times more than they lost. So, W = L. Then W + L =22, so 2W =22, so W=11. But \"1 times more\" is a bit confusing because if they lost L matches, winning 1 times more would mean W = L + L = 2L? Wait, maybe I need to clarify the wording.\n\nIn French, \"gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu\" can be ambiguous. Does it mean they won k times as many as they lost, or k times more than they lost? In English, \"k times more than\" often means k+1 times as many. So, for example, \"2 times more\" means 3 times as many. So, if they won k times more than they lost, that would mean W = (k + 1)*L.\n\nWait, so in that case, if \"k times plus\" is used, it's sometimes interpreted as \"k times as many,\" but sometimes as \"k times more,\" which could be additive. Hmm, I think in French, \"fois plus\" usually means multiplicative. So, \"k fois plus\" means k times as much. So, if they won k times more than they lost, that is W = k*L.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use \"k fois plus\" to mean they have k times more, which would be W = L + k*L = (k+1)*L. So, I need to clarify which interpretation is correct.\n\nIn the original problem, if it's \"gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" it's ambiguous. Hmm. But in mathematics, usually, \"k times more than\" is taken as k times as much, not k times plus the original. So, W = k*L, not W = (k+1)*L. So, I think it's safer to take it as multiplicative.\n\nTherefore, if W = k*L, then W + L =22, so k*L + L =22, so L*(k +1)=22. So, same as before. So, L=22/(k +1). Therefore, k +1 must be a divisor of 22. So, k +1 can be 1,2,11,22. So, k can be 0,1,10,21. But, as before, k=0 would mean they didn't win any matches, which is possible, but the wording suggests that they did win some.\n\nSo, k=1: W =1*L, so total matches: 2*L=22, so L=11, W=11. So, 11 wins and 11 losses. Is that possible? Yeah, they could have a 11-11 record.\n\nk=10: Then, W=10*L, so total matches:10*L + L=11*L=22, so L=2, W=20. So, 20 wins and 2 losses.\n\nk=21: W=21*L, so total matches:21*L + L=22*L=22, so L=1, W=21. So, 21 wins and 1 loss.\n\nBut since the problem is asking \"Combien de fois a-t-elle gagné ?\" which is \"How many times has she won?\" without specifying, but the original problem has a blank in the French, perhaps the k was supposed to be given? Maybe the user made a typo and the problem was supposed to have a number in the blank.\n\nWait, looking back, the original problem is: \"Une équipe de football a joué 22 matchs. Elle a gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu. Combien de fois a-t-elle gagné ?\"\n\nSo, it's definitely a fill-in-the-blank, but the blank is empty. So, perhaps in the original source, there was a number there, but it's missing here. So, without knowing the value of k, I can't give a specific number of wins. But maybe it's expecting me to set up the equation.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider that in the context of the problem, the number of wins is an integer, so k must be such that 22/(k +1) is integer, so possible k values: 0,1,10,21. So, possible numbers of wins: 11,20,21.\n\nBut without knowing k, I can't choose. So, maybe the original problem had a number in the blank, like \"gagné 2 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu.\" If that's the case, then k=2, so W=2*L.\n\nThen, W + L=22, so 2*L + L=3*L=22. Wait, but 22 divided by 3 is not an integer. So, that can't be. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the user just forgot to include the number, but in the problem statement, maybe it's \"gagné 2 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" so k=2. Then, 3*L=22, which is not integer. So, maybe k=3: 4*L=22, which is 5.5, not integer. k=4:5*L=22, 4.4, still not integer. k=5:6*L=22, 3.666... Not integer. k=10:11*L=22, so L=2, which is integer.\n\nWait, so if k=10, then L=2, W=20. So, maybe the original problem had k=10, making 20 wins.\n\nAlternatively, if k=1: W=11, L=11. If k=21: W=21, L=1.\n\nBut without knowing k, I can't know. So, maybe the problem expects me to set up the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem was supposed to say \"gagné 3 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" making W=3*L, so 4*L=22, but 22 isn't divisible by 4, so that's not possible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different number of total matches? But no, it's 22.\n\nWait, perhaps the user had a different number in mind, but it's not here. So, maybe I can think about possible k values that would give integer solutions.\n\nSo, as before, k +1 must be a divisor of 22. So, possible k +1:1,2,11,22. So, k can be 0,1,10,21.\n\nThus, possible number of wins: If k=0: W=0, which is unlikely because the team played 22 matches, so at least they have some wins or losses. But if k=0, they didn't win any, so all 22 are losses. But then, they didn't win any, which is possible, but the problem states \"combien de fois a-t-elle gagné,\" implying they did win some.\n\nSo, k=1: W=11, L=11.\n\nk=10: W=20, L=2.\n\nk=21: W=21, L=1.\n\nSo, these are the possible solutions.\n\nBut since the problem is presented as a fill-in-the-blank with \"gagné _ fois plus,\" but the blank is empty here, perhaps the original problem had a specific k, but it's missing. So, without that, I can't find a specific answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the problem statement, the blank was supposed to be replaced by a number that's not visible here, but in the user's original context, it was filled in. Since I don't have that, maybe I should explain the process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to provide the number but it didn't come through. So, perhaps I can ask for clarification, but since this is a monologue, I can't. So, I have to make an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blank is supposed to be \"2 fois plus,\" so k=2, but as I saw earlier, that would require 3*L=22, which is not integer. So, maybe the problem is wrong or the number is missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the team didn't have any draws, so all matches resulted in wins or losses. So, W + L=22. If W = k*L, then L=22/(k +1). So, depending on k, you get different results.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem had a different number in the blank, and it's a misprint here. Since the user is asking for the number of wins, maybe I can think of a possible k that would make sense.\n\nWait, 22 divided by (k +1) must be integer, so k +1 must be a factor of 22, which is 1,2,11,22. So, k=0,1,10,21.\n\nSo, the possible number of wins are 11,20,21.\n\nSo, unless the problem specifies a particular k, I can't know. So, perhaps the user intended to put a specific number in the blank, but it didn't come through. So, perhaps they can edit the problem to include that.\n\nBut since I have to provide an answer, maybe I can see if the user expects a particular number. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user wrote \"gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu.\" So, the blank is there, but it's empty.

So, perhaps 3, but same problem. Maybe 1, which gives 11 wins. So, maybe 11.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is in French, the user might have written the number in French, like \"deux fois plus,\" but it's blank here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user just wants me to explain the process, but they said to put the final answer in a box, so maybe they expect a numerical answer.\n\nWait, given that, maybe I can think about the most straightforward answer, which is if k=1, so W=11, L=11. So, 11 wins.\n\nAlternatively, if k=10, then 20 wins and 2 losses, which is a very successful team, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, k=21, 21 wins and 1 loss, almost a perfect season.\n\nBut without knowing k, it's impossible to know for sure. So, perhaps in the original problem, k was given, but it didn't come through. So, maybe the answer is 11, assuming k=1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different total number of matches, but it's 22 here.\n\nWait, if I think about the common problems like this, usually the multiple is 2, but as we saw, 22 isn't divisible by 3. So, maybe the multiple is 1, giving 11 wins and 11 losses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 10 times more, giving 20 wins and 2 losses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the wording, maybe it's \"gagné _ fois qu'elle n'a perdu,\" without the \"plus,\" which would mean \"k times as many as they lost,\" so W =k*L. So, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, the user might have meant that the number of wins is k times the number of losses plus something else. Hmm, but the wording is \"gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" which is \"won _ times more than they lost.\"\n\nIn any case, without knowing the specific multiple, I can’t give an exact number. So, perhaps I can conclude that the possible number of wins are 11,20, or 21, depending on the value of k, which is missing here.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had a different total number of matches, but it's 22. Hmm.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is \"gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" meaning that the number of wins is equal to the number of losses plus some multiple. Hmm, no, that's not how it's phrased.\n\nAlternatively, \"gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu\" could be interpreted as W = L + k*L, which is W = (k +1)*L. So, that would mean k times more, in addition to the original L.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then W = (k +1)*L, so W + L =22, so (k +1)*L + L= (k +2)*L=22. So, L=22/(k +2). So, (k +2) must divide 22. Therefore, k +2 can be 1,2,11,22. So, k can be -1,0,9,20.\n\nBut k can't be negative because you can't have negative times more. So, k=0,9,20.\n\nk=0: W = L, so 2*L=22, L=11, W=11.\n\nk=9: W=11*L, so 12*L=22, L=22/12≈1.833, not integer.\n\nk=20: W=22*L, so 23*L=22, L≈0.956, not integer.\n\nSo, only possible is k=0, leading to W=11, L=11.\n\nHmm, so depending on the interpretation of \"k fois plus,\" the answer could be either 11,20,21 or 11. So, if interpreted as multiplicative (W=k*L), then possible W=11,20,21. If interpreted as additive (W=L +k*L=(k +1)*L), then only possible W=11.\n\nSo, in the second interpretation, only 11 is possible, because the others lead to fractional losses. So, maybe the correct interpretation is that W is k times more than L, meaning W = (k +1)*L, so only k=0 is possible, giving 11 wins.\n\nBut the problem says \"gagné _ fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" which would translate more naturally to \"won _ times more than they lost,\" which is usually interpreted as multiplicative. So, W =k*L.\n\nBut in that case, unless k +1 divides 22, you don't get integer solutions. So, since 22 is 2*11, the factors are limited.\n\nSo, if I have to choose, maybe the intended answer is 11, with k=1, so 11 wins and 11 losses.\n\nAlternatively, if it's meant to be 10 times more, so k=10, leading to 20 wins and 2 losses.\n\nBut without knowing, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the original problem had \"gagné deux fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" meaning k=2, which would mean W=2*L. Then, total matches: 2*L + L=3*L=22, which isn't integer. So, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, \"gagné trois fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" so k=3: 4*L=22, which is 5.5, not integer.\n\nHmm, perhaps the original problem had k=1, so W=11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of matches is different, but in the problem, it's 22.\n\nWait, unless the team can have draws, but the problem doesn't mention draws, so it's safe to assume all matches resulted in wins or losses.\n\nSo, in conclusion, without knowing the specific multiple, I can't give an exact number. But based on the factors of 22, the possible number of wins are 11,20, or 21. So, if I had to pick one, maybe 11 is the most straightforward, assuming k=1. So, the team won 11 matches.\n\nBut just to be thorough, if k=10, W=20, L=2, which is also possible. Similarly, if k=21, W=21, L=1.\n\nSo, unless more information is given, all three are possible. Since the problem is presented as a fill-in-the-blank with a missing number, maybe the original problem had k=10, leading to 20 wins. But without knowing, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it, 22 is a small number, so 21 wins and 1 loss is possible, but that's a very high number. 20 wins and 2 losses is also high. 11 wins and 11 losses is a balanced record.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is 11, as it's the most balanced and the simplest.\n\nBut honestly, without the specific multiple, I can't be sure. Maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the number of wins is equal to the number of losses plus some multiple, but without the number, it's unclear.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the blank is supposed to be filled with \"1,\" making it \"gagné 1 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" which would mean they won 1 more match than they lost. So, W = L +1. Then, W + L=22, so L +1 + L=22, so 2L +1=22, so 2L=21, which is not integer. So, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, \"gagné 2 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" meaning W=2*L. Then, 2*L + L=3*L=22, which isn't integer.\n\nWait, maybe it's \"gagné 3 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" so W=3*L, 4*L=22, which is 5.5, not integer.\n\nWait, maybe it's \"gagné 10 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" so W=10*L, 11*L=22, L=2, so W=20.\n\nSo, maybe 20 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, \"gagné 21 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" so W=21*L, 22*L=22, L=1, W=21.\n\nSo, depending on the number, it's 20 or 21.\n\nBut since 20 is more reasonable than 21, maybe 20.\n\nBut I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, if it's \"gagné 1 fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" meaning W=1*L, so 2*L=22, so L=11, W=11. So, 11 is the answer.\n\nWait, but in French, \"gagné une fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu\" would mean W=L, so same number of wins and losses. So, 11 each.\n\nAlternatively, \"gagné deux fois plus qu'elle n'a perdu,\" would mean W=2*L, but as we saw, that leads to non-integer. So, maybe 11 is the intended answer.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most probable answer is 11, assuming the blank was filled with \"1 fois plus,\" leading to 11 wins and 11 losses.\n\nBut, to be safe, I can note that depending on the missing number, the answer could be 11,20, or21.\n\nBut since the problem is presented as a fill-in-the-blank, and the user is asking for the number of wins, I think they expect a specific answer, probably 11.\n\nSo, I'll go with 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe team won \\boxed{11} matches.", "answer_pred": "Let’s denote the number of losses as \\( L \\) and the number of wins as \\( W \\).

So, maybe I can set up an equation for this.\n\nLet me denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Then, Marilyn sold 10 times that, which would be 10H. So together, their sales are H + 10H. That should equal 88,000.\n\nLet me write that out mathematically:\n\nH + 10H = 88,000\n\nHmm, combining like terms, H + 10H is 11H. So, 11H = 88,000.\n\nTo find H, I need to divide both sides by 11. Let me do that:\n\n11H / 11 = 88,000 / 11\n\nSimplifying, H = 8,000.\n\nWait, does that make sense? If Harald sold 8,000 copies, then Marilyn sold 10 times that, which would be 80,000 copies. Adding those together, 8,000 + 80,000 equals 88,000. Yeah, that adds up.\n\nSo, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

{"idx": 89, "question": "Christina organise une fête d'anniversaire et demande 0,75 sac cadeau par invité, vu que 1/4 des invités ne se présentent pas. Sachant qu'elle a invité 16 amis et que les sacs cadeaux coûtent 2 $ chacun, combien va-t-elle dépenser ?", "answer": "24", "raw_response": "Okay, so Christina is organizing a birthday party, and she needs to figure out how much she'll spend on gift bags. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, she's inviting 16 friends, but not all of them will show up. Specifically, 1/4 of the invitees don't come. So, I need to calculate how many people actually attend the party.\n\nLet me write that down. If she invites 16 people and 1/4 don't come, the number of people who will attend is 16 minus 1/4 of 16. Let me compute that. 1/4 of 16 is 4, right? Because 16 divided by 4 is 4. So, 16 minus 4 equals 12. That means 12 friends will actually come to the party.\n\nNow, Christina is asking for 0.75 gift bags per guest. Wait, 0.75 per person? That seems a bit confusing. Maybe it's a typo, or maybe it's intentional. Let me think. If it's 0.75 per person, then for each guest, she needs 0.75 gift bags. But that doesn't make much sense because you can't have a fraction of a gift bag. Maybe it's supposed to be 0.75 per person in terms of something else, but the problem says \"sac cadeau\" which is gift bag. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's 0.75 per person, but she needs to round up or something? Or perhaps it's a misinterpretation.\n\nWait, maybe it's 0.75 gift bags per person, but she wants to have some extra just in case. So maybe she's calculating 0.75 per person, but actually, she can't have 0.75 of a gift bag. So maybe she's calculating how many gift bags she needs by multiplying the number of attendees by 0.75, but then she has to round up to the nearest whole number? Or perhaps it's better to consider it as 3/4 of a gift bag per person, but how does that work?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again. \"Christina organise une fête d'anniversaire et demande 0,75 sac cadeau par invité, vu que 1/4 des invités ne se présentent pas.\" Oh, so she's asking for 0.75 gift bags per invited person, considering that 1/4 won't come. Hmm, maybe it's 0.75 times the number of invited guests? So, regardless of who comes, she's planning based on the number of invitees, but she's adjusting for the fact that some won't show up. So, perhaps she's calculating 0.75 times 16, which is the number of invitees, to get the number of gift bags needed?\n\nWait, but if 1/4 won't come, then the number of attendees is 12, right? So, maybe she's calculating 0.75 times the number of attendees? That would be 0.75 times 12. Let me compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, 0.75 times 16: 0.75 multiplied by 16 is 12. Alternatively, if she's calculating 0.75 times 12, that would be 9. So, which one is it?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"demande 0,75 sac cadeau par invité, vu que 1/4 des invités ne se présentent pas.\" So, it's 0.75 gift bags per invited person, considering that 1/4 won't come. Hmm, so perhaps the 0.75 is per invited person, but since 1/4 won't come, she's adjusting the number of gift bags accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe she's calculating the number of gift bags as 0.75 per invited person, but since not all will come, she's actually using that factor to reduce the number of gift bags needed. So, 0.75 per invited person times the number of invitees? That would be 0.75 times 16, which is 12. So, she needs 12 gift bags.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 0.75 per attendee? If 0.75 per attendee, then it's 0.75 times 12, which is 9. But the problem says \"par invité,\" which means per invited person, not per attendee.\n\nSo, if it's per invited person, then 0.75 times 16 is 12. So, she needs 12 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so 12 times 2 is $24. So, she'll spend $24.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Maybe I misread the problem. It says she's asking for 0.75 sac cadeau par invité, considering that 1/4 des invités ne se présentent pas. So, perhaps she's calculating 0.75 per invited person, but since 1/4 won't come, the total number of gift bags needed is 0.75 multiplied by the number of people who will come, which is 12. So, 0.75 times 12 is 9. So, 9 gift bags, each costing $2, so 9 times 2 is $18.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused because depending on the interpretation, it's either 12 or 9. Let me parse the French again: \"Christina organise une fête d'anniversaire et demande 0,75 sac cadeau par invité, vu que 1/4 des invités ne se présentent pas.\" So, she's asking for 0.75 gift bags per invited person, given that 1/4 of the invited guests won't show up.\n\nWait, so \"par invité\" might mean per invited person, regardless of whether they show up or not. So, she's planning for each invited person, she needs 0.75 gift bags, but since 1/4 won't come, perhaps she's adjusting the number of gift bags needed based on the expected attendees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she's calculating 0.75 times the number of invitees, which is 16, giving 12 gift bags. But if 1/4 won't come, she might need less. So, perhaps she's doing 0.75 times the number of expected attendees, which is 12. So, 0.75 times 12 is 9.\n\nWait, maybe \"vu que 1/4 des invités ne se présentent pas\" is modifying the rate. So, instead of needing 1 gift bag per invitee, she's only needing 0.75 per invitee because 1/4 won't come. So, in total, she's calculating 0.75 times 16, which is 12. So, 12 gift bags.\n\nAlternatively, if she's calculating based on the number of attendees, which is 12, and she wants 0.75 per attendee, then it's 9.\n\nI think the key is in the wording: \"demande 0,75 sac cadeau par invité.\" So, she's asking for 0.75 per invited person. So, 16 invited people times 0.75 is 12. So, 12 gift bags.\n\nBut let's think about why she's adjusting. If 1/4 won't come, maybe she's not expecting to give them a gift bag, so she's only planning for the attendees. So, if she expects 12 people, and she wants 0.75 per attendee, that would be 9. Alternatively, if she's planning 0.75 per invitee, regardless of attendance, that's 12.\n\nI think, given the phrasing, it's 0.75 per invited person, so 16 times 0.75 is 12. So, she needs 12 gift bags.\n\nTherefore, 12 gift bags at $2 each is 12 times 2, which is $24. So, she'll spend $24.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0.75 is the proportion of gift bags she actually needs because 1/4 won't come. So, if she invited 16, she would normally need 16 gift bags, but since 1/4 won't come, she only needs 12 gift bags. So, 12 times 2 is $24.\n\nWait, that makes sense too. So, 16 invitees, normally 16 gift bags, but since 1/4 won't come, she reduces the number by 1/4, so 16 minus 4 is 12. So, 12 gift bags, costing $2 each, is $24.\n\nSo, either way, whether it's 0.75 per invitee, which is 12, or calculating based on the expected attendees, she ends up needing 12 gift bags.\n\nTherefore, the total cost is 12 times 2, which is $24.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't skip a step. She's asking for 0.75 per invité, considering 1/4 won't come. Maybe it's 0.75 per attendee, which is 12, so 0.75 times 12 is 9. So, 9 gift bags, costing $2 each, is $18.\n\nHmm, now I'm even more confused because it could go either way.\n\nPerhaps I need to analyze the French sentence structure. \"Christina organise une fête d'anniversaire et demande 0,75 sac cadeau par invité, vu que 1/4 des invités ne se présentent pas.\"\n\nSo, the main clause is \"Christina organise une fête d'anniversaire et demande 0,75 sac cadeau par invité.\" The reason is \"vu que 1/4 des invités ne se présentent pas.\"\n\nSo, she's asking for 0.75 gift bags per invited person, given that 1/4 won't come. So, perhaps she's adjusting her order based on the expected number of attendees.\n\nSo, if she expects 12 people, and she wants 0.75 gift bags per attendee, that's 9. Alternatively, if she's calculating 0.75 per invitee, that's 12.\n\nWait, \"demande 0,75 sac cadeau par invité\" – so per invité, which is per invited person, not per attendee. So, regardless of whether they come or not, she's asking for 0.75 per invited person. So, 16 invited, 0.75 each, is 12.\n\nAlternatively, the fact that 1/4 ne se présentent pas could mean she's only expecting 12, so she needs 0.75 per attendee, which is 9.\n\nI think it's the former because \"par invité\" is specified. So, she's not changing the rate based on attendance; she's just needing 0.75 per invited person, regardless. So, 16 times 0.75 is 12.\n\nTherefore, the total cost is 12 times 2, which is $24.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"vu que 1/4 des invités ne se présentent pas.\" So, maybe she's adjusting the number of gift bags based on the expected attendees.\n\nSo, instead of 16 invitees, she's expecting 12 attendees, so she needs 0.75 per attendee, which is 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she's considering that each attendee will take 0.75 gift bags, but that seems odd. Or perhaps she's using the 0.75 as a factor because 1/4 won't come.\n\nWait, another way: if normally she would need 1 gift bag per attendee, but since 1/4 won't come, she can reduce the number by 1/4, so 16 minus 4 is 12, so 12 gift bags.\n\nBut the problem says she's asking for 0.75 per invited person, so that's 16 times 0.75 is 12.\n\nAlternatively, if she's using the 0.75 as a multiplier on the expected number of attendees, which is 12, then 0.75 times 12 is 9.\n\nI think the key is in the phrase \"par invité\" – meaning per invited person, not per attendee. So, regardless of whether they come or not, she's calculating 0.75 per invited person. So, 16 times 0.75 is 12.\n\nTherefore, 12 gift bags at $2 each is $24.\n\nBut let me think about the units. If it's 0.75 sac cadeau per invité, and she's inviting 16, then 16 * 0.75 = 12. So, 12 sacs cadeau.\n\nAlternatively, if it's 0.75 per attendee, then 12 * 0.75 = 9. But since it's \"par invité,\" it's per invited person, so 12.\n\nSo, final answer: 12 * 2 = 24.\n\nTherefore, Christina will spend $24.\n\n**Final Answer**\nChristina va dépenser \\boxed{24} dollars.\n</think>\n\nChristina organise une fête d'anniversaire et invite 16 amis.

{"idx": 90, "question": "Ted le tyrannosaure a prévu d'apporter une salade de pommes de terre au pique-nique des dinosaures. Il sait qu'il en faudra 10 livres pour un dinosaure adulte et la moitié de cette quantité pour un enfant. Si 20 adultes et 5 enfants sont présents au pique-nique, combien de kilos de salade de pommes de terre Ted devra-t-il apporter pour espérer nourrir tout le monde ?", "answer": "225", "raw_response": "Okay, so Ted the tyrannosaurus is planning to bring a potato salad to the dinosaur picnic. Hmm, that sounds interesting. I need to figure out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring. The problem says that each adult dinosaur needs 10 pounds of potato salad, and each child dinosaur needs half of that amount. Then there are 20 adults and 5 children attending the picnic. So, I guess I need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for all the adults and all the children combined.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, let's handle the adults. Each adult needs 10 pounds, right? So, if there are 20 adults, then the total amount needed for the adults would be 20 multiplied by 10 pounds. Let me write that out:\n\nTotal for adults = Number of adults × Potato salad per adult\nTotal for adults = 20 × 10 pounds\n\nOkay, 20 times 10 is 200. So, Ted needs 200 pounds of potato salad just for the adults. That seems like a lot, but I guess dinosaurs are big!\n\nNow, moving on to the children. The problem says each child needs half the amount that an adult needs. Since an adult needs 10 pounds, half of that would be 5 pounds. So, each child requires 5 pounds of potato salad. There are 5 children attending, so the total for the children would be 5 multiplied by 5 pounds. Let me calculate that:\n\nTotal for children = Number of children × Potato salad per child\nTotal for children = 5 × 5 pounds\n\n5 times 5 is 25. So, the children will need 25 pounds of potato salad in total. That's definitely less than the adults, which makes sense since they're smaller.\n\nNow, to find out the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, I should add the total for adults and the total for children together. So, that would be 200 pounds plus 25 pounds. Let me write that:\n\nTotal potato salad needed = Total for adults + Total for children\nTotal potato salad needed = 200 pounds + 25 pounds\n\nAdding those together, 200 plus 25 is 225. So, Ted needs 225 pounds of potato salad in total.\n\nWait a second, the question asks for the amount in kilograms, not pounds. Hmm, I almost forgot about that. I need to convert pounds to kilograms. I remember that 1 pound is approximately 0.453592 kilograms. So, to convert 225 pounds to kilograms, I multiply 225 by 0.453592.\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n225 pounds × 0.453592 kg/pound\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, 200 pounds would be 200 × 0.453592, and 25 pounds would be 25 × 0.453592. Then I can add those two results together.\n\nCalculating 200 × 0.453592:\n\n200 × 0.453592 = 90.7184 kilograms\n\nAnd 25 × 0.453592:\n\n25 × 0.453592 = 11.3398 kilograms\n\nNow, adding those two together:\n\n90.7184 kg + 11.3398 kg = 102.0582 kilograms\n\nSo, approximately 102.0582 kilograms. That's the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should calculate 225 × 0.453592 directly.\n\n225 × 0.453592\n\nLet me compute this step by step. 225 can be broken down into 200 + 25, which is what I did earlier, so that should be correct. Alternatively, I can compute 225 × 0.453592 as:\n\nFirst, 200 × 0.453592 = 90.7184 kg\n\nThen, 25 × 0.453592 = 11.3398 kg\n\nAdding them together: 90.7184 + 11.3398 = 102.0582 kg\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, 102.0582 kilograms is the exact amount. But maybe we should round it to a reasonable number of decimal places. Since the original amounts were given in whole pounds and the number of dinosaurs was also a whole number, I think rounding to two decimal places would be appropriate. So, 102.06 kilograms.\n\nAlternatively, if we use a more precise conversion factor, maybe 1 pound is exactly 0.45359237 kilograms. Let me try that. So, 225 pounds × 0.45359237 kg/pound.\n\nCalculating this:\n\n225 × 0.45359237\n\nAgain, breaking it down:\n\n200 × 0.45359237 = 90.718474 kg\n\n25 × 0.45359237 = 11.33980925 kg\n\nAdding those together:\n\n90.718474 + 11.33980925 = 102.05828325 kg\n\nSo, that's approximately 102.0583 kilograms. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 102.06 kilograms.\n\nAlternatively, if we need to present it as a whole number, maybe 102 kilograms. But since 0.0583 is almost 0.06, which is more than half of 0.1, so 102.06 is more precise.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"combien de kilos\" which is \"how many kilos,\" so in French, sometimes decimals are written with commas, but in terms of the answer, I think providing it as 102.06 kg is acceptable, but perhaps they expect it rounded to the nearest whole number. Let me see.\n\nIf we take 102.0583 kg, that is approximately 102.06 kg, which is just a bit over 102 kg. If we round to the nearest whole kilogram, it would be 102 kg because 0.0583 is less than 0.5.\n\nWait, 0.0583 is approximately 0.06, which is less than 0.5, so it would still round down to 102 kg. So, maybe 102 kilograms is the appropriate answer.\n\nLet me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:\n\n1. Calculate total for adults: 20 adults × 10 pounds = 200 pounds\n2. Calculate total for children: 5 children × 5 pounds = 25 pounds\n3. Total pounds: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds\n4. Convert to kilograms: 225 × 0.453592 ≈ 102.06 kg\n5. Rounded to the nearest whole kilogram: 102 kg\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Ted needs to bring approximately 102 kilograms of potato salad to the picnic to feed all the adults and children.\n\nI wonder if there's a simpler way to do this. Maybe instead of calculating pounds first and then converting, I could have converted the per-person amounts first and then multiplied. Let me try that approach to see if I get the same result.\n\nSo, 1 pound is approximately 0.453592 kg. Therefore, 10 pounds is 10 × 0.453592 = 4.53592 kg per adult. Then, each child needs half of that, so 5 pounds is 5 × 0.453592 = 2.26796 kg per child.\n\nThen, total for adults: 20 adults × 4.53592 kg = ?\n\nCalculating 20 × 4.53592:\n\n4.53592 × 20 = 90.7184 kg\n\nTotal for children: 5 children × 2.26796 kg = ?\n\n2.26796 × 5 = 11.3398 kg\n\nAdding together: 90.7184 + 11.3398 = 102.0582 kg\n\nSame result as before. So, whether I calculate in pounds first or convert each amount first, I end up with the same total. So, that's reassuring.\n\nI think I'm confident that 102.06 kilograms is the correct amount, which can be rounded to 102 kilograms. Alternatively, if we want to be precise, we could present it as approximately 102.06 kg, but given the context, 102 kg is probably sufficient.\n\nJust to make sure, let me verify if I interpreted the problem correctly. It says Ted needs to bring potato salad for 20 adults and 5 children, with each adult needing 10 pounds and each child half that, which is 5 pounds. So, 20 × 10 = 200, 5 × 5 = 25, total 225 pounds. Convert to kg: 225 × 0.453592 ≈ 102.06 kg. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI was briefly worried I might have misread something, like whether it's per adult or per child, but no, the problem clearly states 10 pounds per adult and half that per child. So, 10 and 5 pounds respectively.\n\nAnother thing to consider: is the conversion factor correct? 1 pound to kg is indeed approximately 0.453592. Sometimes people approximate it as 0.45 kg for simplicity, but in this case, since we're dealing with a larger quantity, using the more precise conversion factor is better to get an accurate result.\n\nLet me do a quick check using the approximate conversion. If 1 pound is roughly 0.45 kg, then 225 pounds would be 225 × 0.45 = 101.25 kg. So, that's about 101.25 kg, which is close to our precise calculation of approximately 102.06 kg. The slight difference is due to using a rounded conversion factor, which is acceptable for everyday use but less precise for exact calculations.\n\nGiven that the problem is about preparing food for a picnic, it's probably better to have a little extra rather than come up short. So, maybe Ted should round up to ensure he has enough. If we use the precise calculation of about 102.06 kg, he could round up to 103 kg to be safe, but the question asks for the amount needed to \"espérer nourrir tout le monde,\" which translates to \"hope to feed everyone.\" So, maybe 102 kg is sufficient, but if he wants to be extra cautious, he might go with 103 kg.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify needing extra, just the amount needed, I think 102.06 kg is the precise answer, which can be rounded to 102 kg as the final answer.\n\nLet me just write out the steps clearly:\n\n1. Adults: 20 × 10 pounds = 200 pounds\n2. Children: 5 × 5 pounds = 25 pounds\n3. Total pounds: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds\n4. Convert pounds to kilograms: 225 × 0.453592 ≈ 102.06 kg\n5. Rounded to the nearest whole number: 102 kg\n\nTherefore, Ted needs to bring approximately 102 kilograms of potato salad.\n\nI think that's all. I've double-checked my calculations, considered different approaches, and made sure the conversion is accurate. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nTed doit apporter \\boxed{102} kilos de salade de pommes de terre.\n</think>\n\nTed le tyrannosaure doit apporter une salade de pommes de terre pour 20 adultes et 5 enfants.

{"idx": 91, "question": "Jan a trois fois plus d'animaux de compagnie que Marcia. Marcia en a deux de plus que Cindy. Si Cindy a quatre animaux, combien d'animaux au total ont-elles toutes les trois ?", "answer": "28", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have three people: Jan, Marcia, and Cindy. Each of them has some pets, and we need to find out how many pets they have in total. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, the problem says that Jan has three times more pets than Marcia. That means if Marcia has, say, M pets, then Jan has 3 times M, which is 3M. Got that part.\n\nNext, it says Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. So, if Cindy has C pets, then Marcia has C + 2 pets. That makes sense. So, we can write Marcia's pets in terms of Cindy's.\n\nAnd then we're told that Cindy has four pets. So, Cindy's number of pets is given directly. Let me jot that down:\n\n- Cindy has 4 pets. So, C = 4.\n\nNow, since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, we can calculate Marcia's pets. That would be Cindy's pets plus 2. So, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Let me write that:\n\n- Marcia has 6 pets. So, M = 6.\n\nNow, since Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, we can find Jan's pets by multiplying Marcia's number by 3. So, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets. Let me note that:\n\n- Jan has 18 pets.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total number of pets that all three have together. That means we need to add up the pets each of them has. So, let's add Jan's, Marcia's, and Cindy's pets.\n\nAdding them up: 18 (Jan) + 6 (Marcia) + 4 (Cindy). Let me compute that step by step.\n\n18 + 6 is 24. Then, 24 + 4 is 28. So, altogether, they have 28 pets.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Okay, seems consistent.\n\nJust to make sure, I can also represent this with variables and equations to visualize it better.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nC = number of pets Cindy has = 4.\n\nM = number of pets Marcia has = C + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6.\n\nJ = number of pets Jan has = 3 * M = 3 * 6 = 18.\n\nTotal = J + M + C = 18 + 6 + 4 = 28.\n\nYep, that's the same result. So, I think that's solid.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by expressing everything in terms of Cindy's pets and substituting step by step.\n\nLet's see:\n\nSince Cindy has C pets, which is 4.\n\nMarcia has M = C + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6.\n\nJan has J = 3 * M = 3 * (C + 2) = 3 * (4 + 2) = 3 * 6 = 18.\n\nSo, substituting back, we still get the same numbers.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't substitute the numbers right away, but instead kept everything in terms of C, maybe I could write it as:\n\nTotal = J + M + C = 3M + M + C.\n\nBut since M = C + 2, substitute that in:\n\nTotal = 3(C + 2) + (C + 2) + C.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, expand 3(C + 2): 3C + 6.\n\nThen, add (C + 2): 3C + 6 + C + 2.\n\nNow, combine like terms: 3C + C = 4C, and 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, Total = 4C + 8.\n\nNow, substitute C = 4:\n\nTotal = 4*4 + 8 = 16 + 8 = 24. Wait, that doesn't match my earlier total of 28. Hmm, did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again.\n\nIf I express everything in terms of C:\n\nJ = 3M, and M = C + 2.\n\nTherefore, J = 3*(C + 2) = 3C + 6.\n\nSo, total = J + M + C = (3C + 6) + (C + 2) + C.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3C + 6 + C + 2 + C.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3C + C + C = 5C.\n\n6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, Total = 5C + 8.\n\nAh, okay, I see. Earlier, I mistakenly thought Total was 4C + 8, but actually, it's 5C + 8. That was my error.\n\nSo, substituting C = 4:\n\nTotal = 5*4 + 8 = 20 + 8 = 28.\n\nAh, now that makes sense. So, the correct expression is 5C + 8, which gives 28 when C=4. That matches my previous total.\n\nGood, so that method also gives the same result. So, I can be confident that 28 is the correct total number of pets.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Identify what each person has in terms of pets.\n2. Express Marcia's pets in terms of Cindy's: M = C + 2.\n3. Express Jan's pets in terms of Marcia's: J = 3M.\n4. Substitute Cindy's value into Marcia's equation: M = 4 + 2 = 6.\n5. Substitute Marcia's value into Jan's equation: J = 3*6 = 18.\n6. Add all three together: 18 + 6 + 4 = 28.\n\nAlternatively, express everything in terms of Cindy's pets, substitute, and compute.\n\nEither way, I consistently get 28 as the total number of pets.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The key was correctly translating the relationships into equations and then substituting the known value step by step. Initially, when I tried substituting into the total equation, I made a mistake in combining the terms, but upon reviewing, I corrected that and arrived at the same total. So, I feel confident that 28 is the right answer.\n\nAnother way to check is to think about the ratios and differences.\n\nJan has three times as many pets as Marcia. So, if Marcia has 6, Jan has 18, which is three times more. That makes sense because 6 * 3 is 18.\n\nMarcia has two more than Cindy: Cindy has 4, so Marcia has 6, which is two more. That also checks out.\n\nAdding all together: 18 + 6 + 4. 18 + 6 is 24, plus 4 is 28. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors this time. I was careful to check each step and even used two different methods to ensure consistency. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 28.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of pets they have is \\boxed{28}.\n</think>\n\nCindy a 4 animaux de compagnie.

So, we have three people: Jan, Marcia, and Cindy. Each of them has some pets, and we need to find out how many pets they have in total. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, the problem says that Jan has three times more pets than Marcia. That means if Marcia has, say, M pets, then Jan has 3 times M, which is 3M. Got that part.\n\nNext, it says Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. So, if Cindy has C pets, then Marcia has C + 2 pets. That makes sense. So, we can write Marcia's pets in terms of Cindy's.\n\nAnd then we're told that Cindy has four pets. So, Cindy's number of pets is given directly. Let me jot that down:\n\n- Cindy has 4 pets. So, C = 4.\n\nNow, since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, we can calculate Marcia's pets. That would be Cindy's pets plus 2. So, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Let me write that:\n\n- Marcia has 6 pets. So, M = 6.\n\nNow, since Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, we can find Jan's pets by multiplying Marcia's number by 3.

Si Lee court le 400 mètres haies en 38 secondes, quelle est, en secondes, le temps de course de Gérald après son nouveau régime ?", "answer": "36", "raw_response": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, the question is about Lee and Gérald running the 400 meters hurdles. I need to find out Gérald's new time after he improved his speed by 10% due to a change in his diet. \n\nFirst, let me parse the information given. It says, \"Autrefois, Lee courait le 400 mètres haies deux secondes plus vite que Gérald.\" Translating that, it means \"formerly, Lee ran the 400 meters hurdles two seconds faster than Gérald.\" So, in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald. \n\nNow, it also mentions that after changing his diet, Gérald improved his speed by 10%. So, his time should have decreased by 10%. But I need to figure out his new time. \n\nThen, the question gives me Lee's current time: Lee runs the 400 meters hurdles in 38 seconds. So, Lee's current time is 38 seconds. \n\nWait, but the problem says that in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald. So, does that mean that in the past, Lee's time was Gérald's time minus two seconds? Or is it the other way around? \n\nLet me think. If Lee was two seconds faster, that would mean Lee's time was two seconds less than Gérald's. So, if Gérald's time was, say, T seconds, then Lee's time was T - 2 seconds. \n\nBut now, Lee's time is 38 seconds. So, is this Lee's current time? Or is this Lee's time from before? The problem says, \"Lee court le 400 mètres haies en 38 secondes,\" which translates to \"Lee runs the 400 meters hurdles in 38 seconds.\" Since it doesn't specify, but considering the context, it's likely that this is Lee's current time. \n\nSo, if Lee's current time is 38 seconds, and in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald, then Lee's past time would be 38 seconds minus something? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm confusing this. \n\nLet me reconstruct the timeline. There are two points in time: past and present. In the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald. Then, Gérald changed his diet and improved his speed by 10%, which presumably made his time faster (i.e., lower). We need to find Gérald's new time. \n\nBut we are given Lee's current time, which is 38 seconds. But we don't know if Lee's time has changed as well or if he's still running at the same pace. The problem mentions that only Gérald changed his diet, so we can assume Lee's time is still 38 seconds, as that's his current time. \n\nSo, let's denote: \n\n- Let G be Gérald's past time.\n\n- Then, Lee's past time would be G - 2 seconds.\n\nBut now, Gérald has improved his speed by 10%, which means his time has decreased. So, his new time is G - (10% of G) = G * (1 - 0.10) = 0.90 * G.\n\nWe need to find 0.90 * G.\n\nBut to find G, we need to relate it to Lee's current time. Wait, but we need to know if Lee's time has changed. The problem doesn't say Lee changed anything, so perhaps Lee's time is still the same as his past time. But wait, his current time is 38 seconds. So, is that his current time, or is that his past time? \n\nWait, let's read the problem again: \"Autrefois, Lee courait le 400 mètres haies deux secondes plus vite que Gérald. Mais après un changement de régime alimentaire, Gérald a amélioré sa vitesse de 10 %. Si Lee court le 400 mètres haies en 38 secondes, quelle est, en secondes, le temps de course de Gérald après son nouveau régime ?\"\n\nSo, translation: \"formerly, Lee ran the 400 m hurdles two seconds faster than Gérald. But after a change in diet, Gérald improved his speed by 10%. If Lee runs the 400 m hurdles in 38 seconds, what is Gérald's time after his new diet?\"\n\nSo, it seems that Lee's time is 38 seconds now, which is his current time. So, in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald. So, if in the past, Lee was two seconds faster, then Lee's past time was Gérald's past time minus two seconds. \n\nBut now, Lee's time is 38 seconds, which is his current time. So, Lee's time hasn't been mentioned to have changed. So, perhaps Lee's current time is 38 seconds, which is the same as his past time? Or is it different?\n\nWait, no, that might not make sense. Because if Lee's time is 38 seconds now, which is his current time, and in the past, he was two seconds faster than Gérald, then we need to relate Lee's past time to Gérald's past time, and then see how Gérald's time changed.\n\nWait, maybe I need to model this with equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet G_p be Gérald's past time.\n\nThen, Lee's past time, L_p, was G_p - 2 seconds.\n\nNow, Gérald has improved his speed by 10%, so his new time, G_n, is G_p - 0.10 * G_p = 0.90 * G_p.\n\nWe need to find G_n.\n\nBut to find G_n, we need to know G_p.\n\nBut how can we find G_p? We know Lee's current time is 38 seconds. Is that Lee's past time or his current time?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Si Lee court le 400 mètres haies en 38 secondes,\" which could be interpreted as Lee's current time. So, if Lee's current time is 38 seconds, is that his time after any changes? But the problem only mentions Gérald changing his diet. So, perhaps Lee's time hasn't changed.\n\nWait, but in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald. If Lee's current time is 38 seconds, is that the same as his past time, or is it a different time?\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me try to structure it.\n\nThere are two time periods: past and present.\n\nIn the past:\n\n- Lee's time: L_p = G_p - 2\n\nIn the present:\n\n- Gérald's time: G_n = 0.90 * G_p\n\n- Lee's time: L_n = 38 seconds\n\nIs Lee's time now the same as his past time? The problem doesn't specify, but it's possible that Lee's time is still 38 seconds, same as his past time. But that may not necessarily be the case.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"Autrefois, Lee courait le 400 mètres haies deux secondes plus vite que Gérald.\" So, in the past, Lee was two seconds faster. Then, Gérald changed his diet and improved his speed by 10%. Now, Lee runs in 38 seconds. So, is Lee's current time 38 seconds, which could be faster or slower than his past time?\n\nWait, actually, the problem states Lee's current time as 38 seconds. It doesn't say anything about Lee changing his diet or improving. So, it's possible that Lee's time is still 38 seconds, which could be the same as his past time or different.\n\nBut if in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald, then in the past, Lee's time was G_p - 2.\n\nBut now, Lee's time is 38 seconds. Is this Lee's current time, same as his past time? Or is it different?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald, which is now, so perhaps Lee's past time was 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gérald's past time.\n\nWait, that might make more sense. Because the problem says, \"Si Lee court le 400 mètres haies en 38 secondes,\" which might be referring to Lee's current time. So, perhaps Lee's current time is 38 seconds, which is the same as his past time. Therefore, in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald, so Gérald's past time was 40 seconds.\n\nBut then Gérald improved his speed by 10%, so his new time would be 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds. But wait, let's check that.\n\nWait, if Lee's current time is 38 seconds, which is the same as his past time, and in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald, then Gérald's past time was 40 seconds. Then, after improving by 10%, Gérald's time becomes 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds.\n\nBut wait, is Lee's current time the same as his past time? The problem doesn't specify whether Lee has changed his diet or not. It only mentions Gérald changing his diet. So, Lee's time would remain the same, so if Lee's current time is 38 seconds, that's the same as his past time.\n\nTherefore, in the past, Lee's time was 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gérald's past time. Therefore, Gérald's past time was 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.\n\nAfter improving his speed by 10%, Gérald's time becomes 40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.\n\nTherefore, Gérald's new time is 36 seconds.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me consider the alternative interpretation. Maybe Lee's current time is 38 seconds, which is faster than his past time. So, perhaps Lee has also improved, but the problem doesn't mention that. So, I think the first interpretation is correct: Lee's current time is the same as his past time, which is 38 seconds. Therefore, Gérald's past time was 40 seconds, and his new time is 36 seconds.\n\nWait, but let me test another angle. Suppose Lee's current time is 38 seconds, which is faster than his past time. So, perhaps in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald, but now Lee is even faster. But the problem only mentions Gérald changing his diet, so Lee's time hasn't changed. Therefore, if Lee's current time is 38 seconds, that's the same as his past time.\n\nTherefore, in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald, so Gérald's past time was 40 seconds. Gérald improved by 10%, so 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds. So, Gérald's new time is 36 seconds.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 36 seconds.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's lay out all the steps clearly:\n\n1. Let G_p be Gérald's past time.\n\n2. Lee's past time, L_p = G_p - 2.\n\n3. Lee's current time, L_n = 38 seconds.\n\n4. Assuming Lee's time hasn't changed, so L_p = L_n = 38 seconds.\n\n5. Therefore, G_p = L_p + 2 = 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.\n\n6. Gérald's new time, G_n = G_p - 10% of G_p = 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 36 seconds.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe time of Gérald's course after his new diet is \\boxed{36} seconds.\n</think>\n\nFirst, we denote Gérald's past time as \\( G_p \\). Lee's past time, \\( L_p \\), was two seconds faster than Gérald's past time, so we have:\n\n\\[ L_p = G_p - 2 \\]\n\nWe know Lee's current time is 38 seconds, and since there is no mention of Lee changing his diet, we assume his time has not changed. Therefore, Lee's past time \\( L_p \\) is also 38 seconds. Thus, we can write:\n\n\\[ 38 = G_p - 2 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( G_p \\):\n\n\\[ G_p = 38 + 2 = 40 \\]\n\nGérald improved his speed by 10%, which means his new time \\( G_n \\) is 90% of his past time. Therefore, we calculate:\n\n\\[ G_n = 0.90 \\times G_p = 0.90 \\times 40 = 36 \\]\n\nThus, the time of Gérald's course after his new diet is \\(\\boxed{36}\\) seconds.", "thinking_pred": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, the question is about Lee and Gérald running the 400 meters hurdles. I need to find out Gérald's new time after he improved his speed by 10% due to a change in his diet. \n\nFirst, let me parse the information given. It says, \"Autrefois, Lee courait le 400 mètres haies deux secondes plus vite que Gérald.\" Translating that, it means \"formerly, Lee ran the 400 meters hurdles two seconds faster than Gérald.\" So, in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald. \n\nNow, it also mentions that after changing his diet, Gérald improved his speed by 10%. So, his time should have decreased by 10%. But I need to figure out his new time. \n\nThen, the question gives me Lee's current time: Lee runs the 400 meters hurdles in 38 seconds. So, Lee's current time is 38 seconds. \n\nWait, but the problem says that in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald. So, does that mean that in the past, Lee's time was Gérald's time minus two seconds? Or is it the other way around? \n\nLet me think. If Lee was two seconds faster, that would mean Lee's time was two seconds less than Gérald's. So, if Gérald's time was, say, T seconds, then Lee's time was T - 2 seconds. \n\nBut now, Lee's time is 38 seconds. So, is this Lee's current time? Or is this Lee's time from before? The problem says, \"Lee court le 400 mètres haies en 38 secondes,\" which translates to \"Lee runs the 400 meters hurdles in 38 seconds.\" Since it doesn't specify, but considering the context, it's likely that this is Lee's current time. \n\nSo, if Lee's current time is 38 seconds, and in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald, then Lee's past time would be 38 seconds minus something? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm confusing this. \n\nLet me reconstruct the timeline. There are two points in time: past and present. In the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald. Then, Gérald changed his diet and improved his speed by 10%, which presumably made his time faster (i.e., lower). We need to find Gérald's new time. \n\nBut we are given Lee's current time, which is 38 seconds. But we don't know if Lee's time has changed as well or if he's still running at the same pace. The problem mentions that only Gérald changed his diet, so we can assume Lee's time is still 38 seconds, as that's his current time. \n\nSo, let's denote: \n\n- Let G be Gérald's past time.\n\n- Then, Lee's past time would be G - 2 seconds.\n\nBut now, Gérald has improved his speed by 10%, which means his time has decreased. So, his new time is G - (10% of G) = G * (1 - 0.10) = 0.90 * G.\n\nWe need to find 0.90 * G.\n\nBut to find G, we need to relate it to Lee's current time. Wait, but we need to know if Lee's time has changed. The problem doesn't say Lee changed anything, so perhaps Lee's time is still the same as his past time. But wait, his current time is 38 seconds. So, is that his current time, or is that his past time? \n\nWait, let's read the problem again: \"Autrefois, Lee courait le 400 mètres haies deux secondes plus vite que Gérald. Mais après un changement de régime alimentaire, Gérald a amélioré sa vitesse de 10 %. Si Lee court le 400 mètres haies en 38 secondes, quelle est, en secondes, le temps de course de Gérald après son nouveau régime ?\"\n\nSo, translation: \"formerly, Lee ran the 400 m hurdles two seconds faster than Gérald. But after a change in diet, Gérald improved his speed by 10%. If Lee runs the 400 m hurdles in 38 seconds, what is Gérald's time after his new diet?\"\n\nSo, it seems that Lee's time is 38 seconds now, which is his current time. So, in the past, Lee was two seconds faster than Gérald. So, if in the past, Lee was two seconds faster, then Lee's past time was Gérald's past time minus two seconds. \n\nBut now, Lee's time is 38 seconds, which is his current time. So, Lee's time hasn't been mentioned to have changed. So, perhaps Lee's current time is 38 seconds, which is the same as his past time? Or is it different?\n\nWait, no, that might not make sense.

We know Lee's current time is 38 seconds. Is that Lee's past time or his current time?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Si Lee court le 400 mètres haies en 38 secondes,\" which could be interpreted as Lee's current time.

{"idx": 94, "question": "Dans un certain quartier, la population des lapins de compagnie compte douze unités de moins que celle de l'ensemble des chiens et des chats de compagnie. Si pour chaque chien on compte deux chats et qu'il y a en tout 60 chiens, combien d'animaux domestiques y a-t-il au total dans le quartier ?", "answer": "348", "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem here about the population of rabbits, dogs, and cats in a certain neighborhood. Let me try to understand it step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says: \"Dans un certain quartier, la population des lapins de compagnie compte douze unités de moins que celle de l'ensemble des chiens et des chats de compagnie.\" Hmm, translating that, it means the number of pet rabbits is twelve less than the total number of dogs and cats combined. So, if I let R be the number of rabbits, D be the number of dogs, and C be the number of cats, then the equation would be R = (D + C) - 12. Got that down.\n\nNext, it says: \"Si pour chaque chien on compte deux chats...\" Which translates to \"If for each dog there are two cats...\" So, that means the number of cats is twice the number of dogs. If I put that into an equation, it would be C = 2D. I think that's correct because for every dog, there are two cats, so the total number of cats would be double the number of dogs.\n\nAnd then it says: \"et qu'il y a en tout 60 chiens.\" That means, \"and there are in total 60 dogs.\" So, D = 60. Alright, so we know the number of dogs is 60.\n\nSo, to recap, we have:\n1. R = D + C - 12\n2. C = 2D\n3. D = 60\n\nSince D is given as 60, I can plug that into the second equation to find C. Let's do that.\n\nC = 2D = 2 * 60 = 120. So, there are 120 cats.\n\nNow, let's go back to the first equation to find R, the number of rabbits.\n\nR = D + C - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12.\n\nCalculating that: 60 + 120 is 180, and 180 - 12 is 168. So, R = 168.\n\nWait, hold on. That seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nD = 60, so C = 2 * 60 = 120. Then, the total number of dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180. Then, rabbits are 12 less than that, so 180 - 12 = 168. Yeah, that seems right. Maybe 168 rabbits.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood. So that would be the sum of rabbits, dogs, and cats.\n\nSo, total animals = R + D + C = 168 + 60 + 120.\n\nLet me add those up. 168 + 60 is 228, and 228 + 120 is 348.\n\nWait, 168 + 60 is 228? Let me check that again. 168 + 60: 160 + 60 is 220, plus 8 is 228. Then, 228 + 120: 228 + 100 is 328, plus 20 is 348. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of domestic animals is 348.\n\nWait, but let's make sure I didn't misinterpret the first sentence. It says \"la population des lapins de compagnie compte douze unités de moins que celle de l'ensemble des chiens et des chats de compagnie.\" So, rabbits are twelve less than the total of dogs and cats. So, R = (D + C) - 12, which is what I used. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way: If I think in terms of equations, maybe someone else would set it up differently? Let me see.\n\nSuppose someone thought that rabbits are twelve less than dogs and twelve less than cats. But no, the wording is \"douze unités de moins que celle de l'ensemble des chiens et des chats.\" So, it's the total of dogs and cats together, minus twelve. So, that's R = (D + C) - 12. So, I think my initial setup is correct.\n\nGiven that, and D = 60, C = 120, R = 168, so total is 348. Hmm. That seems like a lot, but mathematically, that's what comes out.\n\nI guess to be thorough, let me check each step again.\n\n1. D = 60 (given)\n2. C = 2D = 2*60 = 120 (given ratio)\n3. R = (D + C) - 12 = (60 + 120) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168 (from the first statement)\n4. Total animals = R + D + C = 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.\n\nYeah, that all checks out. So, I think the answer is 348.\n\nBut just to make 100% sure, let me think if there's another way someone might interpret the problem.\n\nAnother possible misinterpretation could be that rabbits are twelve less than dogs and separately twelve less than cats. But that would mean R = D - 12 and R = C - 12, which would require D and C to be equal, but in our case, C = 2D, so that wouldn't hold. So, that interpretation doesn't fit with the given ratio of cats to dogs. So, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could think that the number of rabbits is twelve less than dogs and cats individually? But that would lead to R = D - 12 and R = C - 12, which again, as above, would require D = C, but we know C = 2D, so that's contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that rabbits are twelve less than the total of dogs and cats. So, R = (D + C) - 12, which is what I used, and that leads to the total of 348.\n\nOkay, I think I've considered different interpretations and confirmed that my approach is correct. So, I feel confident that the total number of domestic animals is 348.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood is \\boxed{348}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem, we need to determine the total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood. Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n1. The number of rabbits (R) is twelve less than the total number of dogs (D) and cats (C). This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   R = (D + C) - 12\n   \\]\n\n2. For each dog, there are two cats, so the number of cats is twice the number of dogs:\n   \\[\n   C = 2D\n   \\]\n\n3. The total number of dogs is given as 60:\n   \\[\n   D = 60\n   \\]\n\n4. Using the number of dogs, we can find the number of cats:\n   \\[\n   C = 2 \\times 60 = 120\n   \\]\n\n5. Now, we can find the number of rabbits using the equation from step 1:\n   \\[\n   R = (60 + 120) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168\n   \\]\n\n6. Finally, we calculate the total number of domestic animals by adding the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total} = R + D + C = 168 + 60 + 120 = 348\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood is \\(\\boxed{348}\\).", "thinking_pred": "Okay, so I have this problem here about the population of rabbits, dogs, and cats in a certain neighborhood.

Alright, so we know the number of dogs is 60.\n\nSo, to recap, we have:\n1. R = D + C - 12\n2. C = 2D\n3. D = 60\n\nSince D is given as 60, I can plug that into the second equation to find C. Let's do that.\n\nC = 2D = 2 * 60 = 120. So, there are 120 cats.\n\nNow, let's go back to the first equation to find R, the number of rabbits.\n\nR = D + C - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12.\n\nCalculating that: 60 + 120 is 180, and 180 - 12 is 168. So, R = 168.\n\nWait, hold on. That seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nD = 60, so C = 2 * 60 = 120. Then, the total number of dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180. Then, rabbits are 12 less than that, so 180 - 12 = 168. Yeah, that seems right. Maybe 168 rabbits.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood. So that would be the sum of rabbits, dogs, and cats.\n\nSo, total animals = R + D + C = 168 + 60 + 120.\n\nLet me add those up. 168 + 60 is 228, and 228 + 120 is 348.\n\nWait, 168 + 60 is 228? Let me check that again. 168 + 60: 160 + 60 is 220, plus 8 is 228. Then, 228 + 120: 228 + 100 is 328, plus 20 is 348. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of domestic animals is 348.\n\nWait, but let's make sure I didn't misinterpret the first sentence. It says \"la population des lapins de compagnie compte douze unités de moins que celle de l'ensemble des chiens et des chats de compagnie.\" So, rabbits are twelve less than the total of dogs and cats. So, R = (D + C) - 12, which is what I used. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way: If I think in terms of equations, maybe someone else would set it up differently? Let me see.\n\nSuppose someone thought that rabbits are twelve less than dogs and twelve less than cats. But no, the wording is \"douze unités de moins que celle de l'ensemble des chiens et des chats.\" So, it's the total of dogs and cats together, minus twelve. So, that's R = (D + C) - 12. So, I think my initial setup is correct.\n\nGiven that, and D = 60, C = 120, R = 168, so total is 348. Hmm. That seems like a lot, but mathematically, that's what comes out.\n\nI guess to be thorough, let me check each step again.\n\n1. D = 60 (given)\n2. C = 2D = 2*60 = 120 (given ratio)\n3. R = (D + C) - 12 = (60 + 120) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168 (from the first statement)\n4. Total animals = R + D + C = 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.\n\nYeah, that all checks out. So, I think the answer is 348.\n\nBut just to make 100% sure, let me think if there's another way someone might interpret the problem.\n\nAnother possible misinterpretation could be that rabbits are twelve less than dogs and separately twelve less than cats. But that would mean R = D - 12 and R = C - 12, which would require D and C to be equal, but in our case, C = 2D, so that wouldn't hold. So, that interpretation doesn't fit with the given ratio of cats to dogs. So, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could think that the number of rabbits is twelve less than dogs and cats individually? But that would lead to R = D - 12 and R = C - 12, which again, as above, would require D = C, but we know C = 2D, so that's contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that rabbits are twelve less than the total of dogs and cats. So, R = (D + C) - 12, which is what I used, and that leads to the total of 348.\n\nOkay, I think I've considered different interpretations and confirmed that my approach is correct. So, I feel confident that the total number of domestic animals is 348.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood is \\boxed{348}.", "answer_pred": "Given the problem, we need to determine the total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood. Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n1. The number of rabbits (R) is twelve less than the total number of dogs (D) and cats (C).

Sachant qu'il y avait initialement 30 voitures sur l'autoroute, combien de voitures ont traversé l'embouteillage au cours des 15 premières minutes ?", "answer": "5", "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem here about cars stuck in a traffic jam on the highway. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nFirst, there were initially 30 cars on the highway. Then, some cars managed to move forward during the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam. After that, 20 more cars were able to move during the last 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars left the line to avoid going through the traffic jam. The question is asking how many cars went through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. Initially, there are 30 cars. Some cars get through in the first 15 minutes, then 20 more get through in the last 15 minutes. Also, 5 cars left to avoid the jam. So, how does this all add up?\n\nWait, so the total number of cars that went through the traffic jam would be the initial 30 minus the 5 that left, right? Because those 5 didn't go through. So, 30 minus 5 is 25 cars. \n\nNow, out of these 25 cars, 20 went through in the last 15 minutes. So, the remaining cars must have gone through in the first 15 minutes. So, 25 total minus 20 in the last 15 minutes equals 5 cars in the first 15 minutes.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nSo, initial cars: 30. Cars that left: 5. So, 30 - 5 = 25 cars went through the jam at some point. Then, of those 25, 20 went through in the last 15 minutes, so the rest must have gone through in the first 15 minutes. So, 25 - 20 = 5. So, 5 cars went through in the first 15 minutes.\n\nLet me think about it another way to make sure.\n\nImagine the traffic jam starts, and after 15 minutes, 5 cars have managed to get through. Then, the traffic jam continues for another 15 minutes, during which 20 more cars get through. But also, 5 cars decided to leave the line to avoid it.\n\nSo, the total number that went through is 5 + 20 = 25. But since there were 30 cars initially, 30 - 25 = 5 cars left. Wait, but the problem says 5 cars left. So, that matches up. So, 5 cars left, 25 went through, and of those 25, 5 went through in the first 15 minutes and 20 in the last 15 minutes.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. So, the question is asking for how many went through in the first 15 minutes, which is 5.\n\nBut let me visualize this with maybe a diagram or something.\n\nImagine the initial 30 cars. Then, during the first 15 minutes, some cars (let's call this number x) get through. So, after the first 15 minutes, the number of cars remaining in the line is 30 - x. But then, 5 cars decide to leave, so now there are 30 - x - 5 cars left. Then, during the next 15 minutes, 20 cars get through. So, the number of cars remaining after that would be 30 - x - 5 - 20. But wait, if all cars either get through or leave, then the total number that got through is x + 20, and the number that left is 5. So, x + 20 + 5 = 30, which gives x + 25 = 30, so x = 5. So, that confirms it.\n\nSo, the number of cars that went through in the first 15 minutes is 5.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not misunderstanding the problem. It says \"Certaines voitures parviennent à avancer durant les 15 premières minutes de l'embouteillage, puis 20 autres voitures durant les 15 dernières.\" So, it's 15 premières minutes and then 15 dernières minutes. So, the total time of the traffic jam is 30 minutes, right? 15 minutes initial and 15 minutes last.\n\nSo, starting with 30 cars, 5 cars leave, so 25 cars go through. Of those 25, 5 go through in the first 15 minutes, and 20 go through in the last 15 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 20 cars in the last 15 minutes are in addition to the 5 that left. Wait, but the problem says \"5 voitures sortent de la file pour ne pas avoir à traverser l'embouteillage.\" So, those 5 cars left entirely, meaning they didn't go through at all. So, the total that went through is 30 - 5 = 25. Then, 5 in the first 15 minutes, 20 in the last 15 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider another perspective. Suppose during the entire 30 minutes, 5 cars left, so 25 went through. The problem states that during the first 15 minutes, some cars went through, and during the last 15 minutes, 20 went through. So, the total that went through is x + 20 = 25, which gives x = 5.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, 5 cars went through in the first 15 minutes.\n\nI think that's solid. Maybe I can write it out step by step.\n\n1. Total initial cars: 30.\n2. Cars that left: 5.\n3. Therefore, cars that went through the jam: 30 - 5 = 25.\n4. Of these 25, 20 went through in the last 15 minutes.\n5. So, cars that went through in the first 15 minutes: 25 - 20 = 5.\n\nYep, that seems to line up perfectly.\n\nI don't see any other interpretations that would change this result. It's straightforward subtraction once you account for the cars that left. So, I feel confident that the answer is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of cars that traversed the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes is \\boxed{5}.\n</think>\n\nInitially, there were 30 cars on the highway. During the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, some cars managed to move forward. Then, 20 more cars moved forward during the last 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars left the line to avoid the traffic jam.\n\nTo find out how many cars traversed the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. The total number of cars that went through the traffic jam is the initial number of cars minus the number of cars that left.\n   \\[\n   30 - 5 = 25\n   \\]\n2. Out of these 25 cars, 20 went through during the last 15 minutes. Therefore, the number of cars that went through during the first 15 minutes is:\n   \\[\n   25 - 20 = 5\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of cars that traversed the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes is \\boxed{5}.", "thinking_pred": "Okay, so I have this problem here about cars stuck in a traffic jam on the highway. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nFirst, there were initially 30 cars on the highway. Then, some cars managed to move forward during the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam. After that, 20 more cars were able to move during the last 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars left the line to avoid going through the traffic jam. The question is asking how many cars went through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. Initially, there are 30 cars. Some cars get through in the first 15 minutes, then 20 more get through in the last 15 minutes. Also, 5 cars left to avoid the jam. So, how does this all add up?\n\nWait, so the total number of cars that went through the traffic jam would be the initial 30 minus the 5 that left, right? Because those 5 didn't go through. So, 30 minus 5 is 25 cars. \n\nNow, out of these 25 cars, 20 went through in the last 15 minutes. So, the remaining cars must have gone through in the first 15 minutes. So, 25 total minus 20 in the last 15 minutes equals 5 cars in the first 15 minutes.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nSo, initial cars: 30. Cars that left: 5. So, 30 - 5 = 25 cars went through the jam at some point. Then, of those 25, 20 went through in the last 15 minutes, so the rest must have gone through in the first 15 minutes. So, 25 - 20 = 5. So, 5 cars went through in the first 15 minutes.\n\nLet me think about it another way to make sure.\n\nImagine the traffic jam starts, and after 15 minutes, 5 cars have managed to get through. Then, the traffic jam continues for another 15 minutes, during which 20 more cars get through. But also, 5 cars decided to leave the line to avoid it.\n\nSo, the total number that went through is 5 + 20 = 25. But since there were 30 cars initially, 30 - 25 = 5 cars left. Wait, but the problem says 5 cars left. So, that matches up. So, 5 cars left, 25 went through, and of those 25, 5 went through in the first 15 minutes and 20 in the last 15 minutes.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. So, the question is asking for how many went through in the first 15 minutes, which is 5.\n\nBut let me visualize this with maybe a diagram or something.\n\nImagine the initial 30 cars. Then, during the first 15 minutes, some cars (let's call this number x) get through. So, after the first 15 minutes, the number of cars remaining in the line is 30 - x. But then, 5 cars decide to leave, so now there are 30 - x - 5 cars left. Then, during the next 15 minutes, 20 cars get through. So, the number of cars remaining after that would be 30 - x - 5 - 20. But wait, if all cars either get through or leave, then the total number that got through is x + 20, and the number that left is 5. So, x + 20 + 5 = 30, which gives x + 25 = 30, so x = 5. So, that confirms it.\n\nSo, the number of cars that went through in the first 15 minutes is 5.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not misunderstanding the problem. It says \"Certaines voitures parviennent à avancer durant les 15 premières minutes de l'embouteillage, puis 20 autres voitures durant les 15 dernières.\" So, it's 15 premières minutes and then 15 dernières minutes. So, the total time of the traffic jam is 30 minutes, right? 15 minutes initial and 15 minutes last.\n\nSo, starting with 30 cars, 5 cars leave, so 25 cars go through. Of those 25, 5 go through in the first 15 minutes, and 20 go through in the last 15 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 20 cars in the last 15 minutes are in addition to the 5 that left. Wait, but the problem says \"5 voitures sortent de la file pour ne pas avoir à traverser l'embouteillage.\" So, those 5 cars left entirely, meaning they didn't go through at all. So, the total that went through is 30 - 5 = 25. Then, 5 in the first 15 minutes, 20 in the last 15 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5.

So, Marie loves gardening, and she has a bunch of plants in pots. Let me break down the information step by step.\n\nFirst, Marie received 18 new plants in pots yesterday. So, that's 18 more plants added to her collection. But she already had some plants before that. It says she had 2 plants on each of the 40 windowsills in her big countryside house. Hmm, okay, so she has 40 windowsills, and each had 2 plants. Let me calculate how many plants she had before receiving the new ones.\n\nIf each of the 40 windowsills has 2 plants, then the total number of plants she had initially is 40 multiplied by 2. Let me write that down:\n\n40 windowsills × 2 plants per windowsill = 80 plants.\n\nSo, Marie had 80 plants before she got the new ones. Then, she received 18 more plants. So, the total number of plants she has now is 80 plus 18. Let me add that up:\n\n80 + 18 = 98 plants.\n\nSo, now Marie has 98 plants in total. But then, she decided that tomorrow, she will take 1 plant from each windowsill to give to her friends and family.

Let me confirm that:\n\n40 windowsills × 1 plant per windowsill = 40 plants.\n\nTherefore, she will give away 40 plants. So, to find out how many plants she will have left, I need to subtract the number of plants she gives away from her current total.\n\nMarie currently has 98 plants, and she gives away 40, so:\n\n98 - 40 = 58 plants.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.

I need to figure out the total number of times the bell rang. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the information given:\n\n1. The first friend pressed the bell 20 times.\n2. The second friend pressed it 1/4 of a times more than the first.\n3. The third friend pressed it 10 times more than the fourth.\n4. The fourth friend pressed it 60 times.\n\nSo, I need to find out how many times each friend pressed the bell and then add them all up for the total.\n\nStarting with the first friend: it's straightforward, 20 times. That's given directly.\n\nNow, moving on to the second friend. It says the second pressed 1/4 of a times more than the first. Hmm, the wording here is a bit tricky. Does it mean the second friend pressed 1/4 times as many as the first, or 1/4 more than the first?\n\nWait, the original French says \"1/4 de fois plus que le premier.\" Translating that, \"1/4 de fois plus\" would mean 1/4 times more. So, in mathematical terms, if the first is 20, then the second is 20 plus 1/4 of 20. Let me compute that.\n\n1/4 of 20 is 5, so 20 + 5 = 25. So, the second friend pressed the bell 25 times.\n\nHmm, just to make sure I didn't misinterpret: if it had said \"1/4 fois autant que le premier,\" that would have meant 1/4 as much, which would be 5. But \"plus\" indicates addition, so yeah, it's 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nMoving on to the third and fourth friends. It says the third pressed 10 times more than the fourth. The fourth pressed 60 times. So, how does that work?\n\nAgain, careful with the wording. \"10 fois plus que le quatrième.\" So, 10 times more than the fourth. So, that would mean the third friend pressed 10 times the number of times the fourth did. So, 10 multiplied by the fourth's presses.\n\nGiven that the fourth pressed 60 times, then the third pressed 10 * 60 = 600 times. Is that right? Let me think. If it's 10 times more, does that mean 10 times as much? Or does it mean 10 times the amount plus the original? Hmm, in French, \"10 fois plus\" generally means 10 times as much, not 10 times more on top of the original.\n\nWait, actually in some contexts, \"10 fois plus\" can be ambiguous. But in mathematical problems, it usually means multiplying by 10. So, if the fourth pressed 60, then the third pressed 10 * 60 = 600. So, 600 times.\n\nAlternatively, if it had meant 10 times more in addition, it would have been 60 + 10*60 = 660, but that seems less likely. Given the structure of the problem, it's more probable that it's 10 times as much, so 600.\n\nSo, let me list out all four friends:\n\n1. First friend: 20 times\n2. Second friend: 25 times\n3. Third friend: 600 times\n4.

Let me write that out:\n\n4 (science) + 20 (social studies) + 7 (history) + 8 (geography)\n\nLet me compute that. 4 plus 20 is 24, right? Then, 24 plus 7 is 31, and 31 plus 8 is 39. So, in total, he needs to read 39 pages.\n\nWait, hold on, 4 + 20 is actually 24? No, wait, 4 + 20 is 24? Hmm, wait, no, 4 + 20 is 24? No, that doesn't sound right. Let me do that again. 4 + 20. 4 plus 20 is 24? Wait, no, 4 + 20 is 24? No, 4 plus 20 is 24? Hmm, I think I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, 4 plus 20 is definitely 24? No, wait, 4 plus 20 is 24? Wait, 4 plus 20 is 24? No, hold on, 20 + 4 is 24? Wait, no, 20 + 4 is 24? That’s correct. 20 + 4 is 24. Then 24 + 7 is 31, and 31 + 8 is 39. So, 39 pages in total. Okay, that seems right.\n\nBut let me double-check just to be sure. Sometimes when adding, especially mentally, it's easy to slip up. So, 4 pages for science. 20 pages for social studies. That's 24. 7 pages for history, so that's 31. 8 pages for geography, so that's 39. Yep, 39 total pages.\n\nNow, the problem says that on Monday, he already read 15 pages. So, he's already completed some of his reading. I need to subtract those 15 pages from the total to find out how many pages he still has left to read.\n\nSo, 39 total pages minus 15 pages he has already read. Let me compute that: 39 - 15. Hmm, 39 minus 15 is 24. So, he still has 24 pages left to read.\n\nAlright, now, he has 4 days left to finish reading. The question is asking how many pages he needs to read each day on average. So, that would be the number of pages remaining divided by the number of days left.\n\nSo, 24 pages divided by 4 days. Let me do that division. 24 divided by 4 is 6. So, he needs to read 6 pages each day on average to finish all his reading in 4 days.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in my calculations. So, starting from the beginning, total pages: 4 + 20 + 7 + 8. 4 + 20 is 24, right? 24 + 7 is 31, 31 + 8 is 39. So, total 39 pages. He read 15 on Monday, so 39 - 15 is 24 pages left. Then, 24 divided by 4 days is 6 pages per day.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by calculating how many pages he has left in each subject? But no, the problem is asking for the average number of pages per day, regardless of the subject. So, the total pages left divided by the number of days is the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check my answer by seeing if 6 pages a day for 4 days would indeed bring the total to 24 pages, which when added to the 15 he already read, would make 39. Let's do that: 6 pages/day * 4 days = 24 pages. 24 + 15 = 39, which matches the total number of pages he needs to read. So, that checks out.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 6 pages per day on average.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. It says he has to read 4 pages of science, 20 of social studies, 7 of history, and 8 of geography. So, that's correct, 4+20+7+8 is 39. He has already read 15 pages on Monday, so that's correct, 39-15=24. Then, 24 pages over 4 days is 6 pages per day. Hmm.\n\nIs there any chance that he has to read a certain number of pages per subject each day? The problem doesn't specify that. It just says he has to read 4 pages of science, etc., but doesn't specify per day. So, the total is 39 pages, and he needs to finish them in 4 days, having already read 15. So, 24 left, 6 per day. So, yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nJust to think about it another way, if he reads 6 pages each day, on Tuesday he reads 6, Wednesday 6, Thursday 6, Friday 6. That's 24 pages. Plus the 15 he read on Monday is 39, which is all he needs. So, that works out.\n\nI was just making sure there's no hidden trick in the question, like maybe the pages per subject have to be read in a certain order or something. But the problem doesn't specify that. It just gives the total pages per subject and the total he's read so far. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after calculating the total pages, subtracting the ones he's already read, and dividing by the number of days left, I find that he needs to read an average of 6 pages each day.\n\n**Final Answer**\nSolo doit lire en moyenne \\boxed{6} pages chaque jour.\n</think>\n\nSolo doit lire un certain nombre de pages de plusieurs manuels.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that Jean drinks a glass of water at breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. Then, before going to bed, he also drinks another glass. So, that's four times a day. Wait, let me make sure: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed. Yep, that's four glasses each day.\n\nNow, the question is about a week, right? So, if he does this every day, then for each day, it's four glasses. But hold on, the problem mentions something about the weekend. It says that on weekends, he likes to relax and drink a soda instead of water at dinner. Hmm, so on weekends, instead of having water at dinner, he has soda. That means on weekends, he doesn't have water at dinner, but does he still have it at breakfast, lunch, and before bed?\n\nLet me re-read that part: \"Le week-end par contre, il aime se détendre et boire un soda au dîner.\" So, it specifically mentions that at dinner on weekends, he drinks soda. So, that implies he doesn't have water at dinner on weekends. But what about the other meals?\n\nDoes he still drink water at breakfast and lunch on weekends? The problem doesn't say he stops drinking water entirely on weekends, just that he drinks soda at dinner. So, I think he still continues his usual routine except for dinner on weekends.\n\nSo, during the weekdays (Monday to Friday), he drinks four glasses of water each day: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed. On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he drinks water at breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but at dinner, he has soda instead. So, that's three glasses on each weekend day.\n\nAlright, so let's calculate this:\n\nFirst, weekdays: 5 days. Each day, he drinks 4 glasses. So, 5 times 4 is 20 glasses.\n\nNow, weekends: 2 days.

If all days were the same, he would have 4 glasses per day, which is 28. But on weekends, he's replacing one glass of water with soda each day. So, two days where he drinks one less glass.

{"idx": 103, "question": "Un banc de brouillard arrive de l'océan et recouvre progressivement une ville. Il met 10 minutes pour couvrir 3 miles de la ville. Si la ville s'étend sur 42 miles depuis le bord de l'océan jusqu'au bord opposé à l'intérieur des terres, combien de minutes faudra-t-il au banc de brouillard pour couvrir toute la ville ?", "answer": "140", "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a fog bank moving over a city. Let me try to understand it step by step. The fog is coming from the ocean and gradually covering the city. It takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles of the city. The city stretches 42 miles from the ocean to the far inland border. I need to find out how many minutes it will take for the fog to cover the entire city.\n\nAlright, so first, let me break down the information given. The fog covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. So, that gives me a rate at which the fog is moving. I can probably calculate the speed of the fog by dividing the distance by time. So, speed equals distance divided by time, right?\n\nLet me write that down. Speed = distance / time. The distance is 3 miles, and the time is 10 minutes. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be 3 miles divided by 10 minutes. Hmm, 3 divided by 10 is 0.3. So, the fog is moving at 0.3 miles per minute. Wait, is that correct? Let me check my calculations again. 3 miles in 10 minutes, so yes, 3/10 is 0.3. That seems right.\n\nSo, if the fog is moving at 0.3 miles per minute, then to find out how long it takes to cover the entire city, which is 42 miles from one end to the other, I can use the same formula but rearranged. Time equals distance divided by speed. So, time = 42 miles / 0.3 miles per minute.\n\nLet me compute that. 42 divided by 0.3. Hmm, 42 divided by 0.3 is the same as 42 multiplied by (10/3), because dividing by a decimal can sometimes be tricky. Let me see, 0.3 is equal to 3/10, so dividing by 3/10 is the same as multiplying by 10/3. So, 42 multiplied by 10 is 420, and then divided by 3 is 140. So, 42 divided by 0.3 equals 140. Therefore, the time it would take is 140 minutes.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. Another way to think about it is how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles. Since 3 miles take 10 minutes, then the number of 3-mile segments in 42 miles is 42 divided by 3, which is 14. So, 14 segments, each taking 10 minutes, so 14 times 10 minutes is 140 minutes. Yeah, that seems consistent.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe using unit conversion? Let's see. If the fog covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, then per mile, how much time does it take? So, 10 minutes divided by 3 miles is approximately 3.333 minutes per mile. Then, for 42 miles, it would be 42 times 3.333 minutes. Let me compute that.\n\n42 multiplied by 3.333. Well, 40 times 3.333 is 133.333, and 2 times 3.333 is 6.666, so adding them together, 133.333 plus 6.666 is 140 minutes. So, that method also gives me 140 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the rate as miles per minute. As I did before, 0.3 miles per minute. So, if I have a distance of 42 miles, time is 42 divided by 0.3, which is 140 minutes. All these methods seem to converge on the same answer.\n\nWait a second, but hold on. Is the fog starting from the ocean and moving inland, so does that mean the entire city is 42 miles from the ocean to the opposite border? So, the fog needs to cover that entire 42-mile stretch. So, the time it takes is just based on how long it takes for the fog to traverse 42 miles at its speed. So, yes, 140 minutes.\n\nIs there any chance that I might have misread the problem? Let me check again. It says the fog arrives from the ocean and progressively covers the city. It takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles of the city. The city extends 42 miles from the ocean to the opposite border. So, yeah, it's 42 miles in total that the fog has to cover. So, the time should be 42 divided by the speed, which is 0.3 miles per minute, giving 140 minutes.\n\nHmm, is there another factor I need to consider? Like, does the fog start at the ocean and take time to cover each subsequent mile? So, the first 3 miles take 10 minutes, but does that mean that the entire city is being covered as the fog moves in, so the total coverage time is the same as the time it takes for the fog to reach the far end?\n\nWait, actually, now that I think about it, the problem says the fog arrives from the ocean and recovers \"progressively\" a city. So, the coverage starts at the ocean and moves inland. So, the entire city is 42 miles long from the ocean to the far end. So, the fog needs to cover that entire length. So, if it's moving at 0.3 miles per minute, then to cover 42 miles, it's 42 / 0.3 = 140 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if we think about the leading edge of the fog, it needs to travel 42 miles at 0.3 miles per minute, which is 140 minutes. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, is there a possibility that the fog's coverage is not just moving forward, but also thickening or something? The problem doesn't mention anything about the fog's thickness or vertical coverage, just that it's covering the city. So, I think we can assume that it's moving along the horizontal axis from the ocean to the inland, and the 3 miles in 10 minutes is the horizontal distance.\n\nTherefore, given that, the time to cover the entire 42-mile length would be 140 minutes.\n\nLet me just recap. The fog covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, so speed is 0.3 miles per minute. The city is 42 miles long, so time required is 42 / 0.3, which is 140 minutes. Converting that into hours, that's 2 hours and 20 minutes, but the question asks for minutes, so 140 minutes is the answer.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can visualize it. If in 10 minutes, 3 miles are covered, then in 20 minutes, 6 miles would be covered, 30 minutes - 9 miles, 40 minutes - 12 miles, 50 minutes - 15 miles, 60 minutes - 18 miles, 70 minutes - 21 miles, 80 minutes - 24 miles, 90 minutes - 27 miles, 100 minutes - 30 miles, 110 minutes - 33 miles, 120 minutes - 36 miles, 130 minutes - 39 miles, and 140 minutes - 42 miles. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo, each 10 minutes, it's adding another 3 miles. So, after 140 minutes, it's covered 14 segments of 3 miles each, which is 42 miles total. So, that adds up correctly.\n\nTherefore, I think I've thought through this thoroughly, checked it multiple ways, and each time it comes out to 140 minutes. So, I feel confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe banc de brouillard mettra \\boxed{140} minutes pour couvrir toute la ville.\n</think>\n\nThe fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, giving a speed of 0.3 miles per minute.

That seems right.\n\nSo, if the fog is moving at 0.3 miles per minute, then to find out how long it takes to cover the entire city, which is 42 miles from one end to the other, I can use the same formula but rearranged. Time equals distance divided by speed. So, time = 42 miles / 0.3 miles per minute.\n\nLet me compute that. 42 divided by 0.3. Hmm, 42 divided by 0.3 is the same as 42 multiplied by (10/3), because dividing by a decimal can sometimes be tricky. Let me see, 0.3 is equal to 3/10, so dividing by 3/10 is the same as multiplying by 10/3. So, 42 multiplied by 10 is 420, and then divided by 3 is 140. So, 42 divided by 0.3 equals 140. Therefore, the time it would take is 140 minutes.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. Another way to think about it is how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles. Since 3 miles take 10 minutes, then the number of 3-mile segments in 42 miles is 42 divided by 3, which is 14. So, 14 segments, each taking 10 minutes, so 14 times 10 minutes is 140 minutes. Yeah, that seems consistent.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe using unit conversion? Let's see. If the fog covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, then per mile, how much time does it take? So, 10 minutes divided by 3 miles is approximately 3.333 minutes per mile. Then, for 42 miles, it would be 42 times 3.333 minutes. Let me compute that.\n\n42 multiplied by 3.333. Well, 40 times 3.333 is 133.333, and 2 times 3.333 is 6.666, so adding them together, 133.333 plus 6.666 is 140 minutes. So, that method also gives me 140 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the rate as miles per minute. As I did before, 0.3 miles per minute. So, if I have a distance of 42 miles, time is 42 divided by 0.3, which is 140 minutes. All these methods seem to converge on the same answer.\n\nWait a second, but hold on. Is the fog starting from the ocean and moving inland, so does that mean the entire city is 42 miles from the ocean to the opposite border? So, the fog needs to cover that entire 42-mile stretch. So, the time it takes is just based on how long it takes for the fog to traverse 42 miles at its speed. So, yes, 140 minutes.\n\nIs there any chance that I might have misread the problem? Let me check again. It says the fog arrives from the ocean and progressively covers the city. It takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles of the city. The city extends 42 miles from the ocean to the opposite border. So, yeah, it's 42 miles in total that the fog has to cover. So, the time should be 42 divided by the speed, which is 0.3 miles per minute, giving 140 minutes.\n\nHmm, is there another factor I need to consider? Like, does the fog start at the ocean and take time to cover each subsequent mile? So, the first 3 miles take 10 minutes, but does that mean that the entire city is being covered as the fog moves in, so the total coverage time is the same as the time it takes for the fog to reach the far end?\n\nWait, actually, now that I think about it, the problem says the fog arrives from the ocean and recovers \"progressively\" a city. So, the coverage starts at the ocean and moves inland. So, the entire city is 42 miles long from the ocean to the far end. So, the fog needs to cover that entire length. So, if it's moving at 0.3 miles per minute, then to cover 42 miles, it's 42 / 0.3 = 140 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if we think about the leading edge of the fog, it needs to travel 42 miles at 0.3 miles per minute, which is 140 minutes. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, is there a possibility that the fog's coverage is not just moving forward, but also thickening or something? The problem doesn't mention anything about the fog's thickness or vertical coverage, just that it's covering the city. So, I think we can assume that it's moving along the horizontal axis from the ocean to the inland, and the 3 miles in 10 minutes is the horizontal distance.\n\nTherefore, given that, the time to cover the entire 42-mile length would be 140 minutes.\n\nLet me just recap. The fog covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, so speed is 0.3 miles per minute. The city is 42 miles long, so time required is 42 / 0.3, which is 140 minutes. Converting that into hours, that's 2 hours and 20 minutes, but the question asks for minutes, so 140 minutes is the answer.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can visualize it. If in 10 minutes, 3 miles are covered, then in 20 minutes, 6 miles would be covered, 30 minutes - 9 miles, 40 minutes - 12 miles, 50 minutes - 15 miles, 60 minutes - 18 miles, 70 minutes - 21 miles, 80 minutes - 24 miles, 90 minutes - 27 miles, 100 minutes - 30 miles, 110 minutes - 33 miles, 120 minutes - 36 miles, 130 minutes - 39 miles, and 140 minutes - 42 miles. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo, each 10 minutes, it's adding another 3 miles. So, after 140 minutes, it's covered 14 segments of 3 miles each, which is 42 miles total. So, that adds up correctly.\n\nTherefore, I think I've thought through this thoroughly, checked it multiple ways, and each time it comes out to 140 minutes. So, I feel confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe banc de brouillard mettra \\boxed{140} minutes pour couvrir toute la ville.", "answer_pred": "The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, giving a speed of 0.3 miles per minute.

Let me see how I can figure out how many pieces are left to place after she and her mom have placed some. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the plateau. A quarter of 1000 is... well, 1000 divided by 4. Let me do that calculation. 1000 ÷ 4 equals 250. So, Poppy places 250 pieces. That means the number of pieces left after her placement would be the total minus what she placed. So, 1000 minus 250 is 750. Okay, so 750 pieces are left after Poppy's turn.\n\nNow, her mother comes in and places a third of the remaining pieces. Hmm, so it's a third of 750. Let me calculate that. 750 divided by 3 is 250. So, her mom places another 250 pieces. That means the number of pieces left after her mom's placement is the remaining pieces minus what her mom placed. So, 750 minus 250 is 500.\n\nWait a second, let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 1000 pieces, Poppy places a quarter. 1000 ÷ 4 is 250. So, 1000 - 250 is indeed 750. Then her mom places a third of that, which is 750 ÷ 3, which is 250. So, 750 - 250 is 500. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it is: after Poppy places her pieces, 750 are left. Her mom takes a third of those, which is 250, so subtracting that from 750 gives 500. That makes sense.\n\nWait, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by calculating the remaining pieces after each step as a percentage or fraction? Let's see.\n\nAfter Poppy places a quarter, which is 25%, she's left with 75% of the original pieces. 75% of 1000 is 750, which matches what I had before. Then her mom places a third of those, so she's placing 33.333...% of 750, which is 250. So, 750 minus 250 leaves 500 pieces. Yeah, same result.\n\nI wonder if I can represent this with equations. Let me try that.\n\nLet the total number of pieces be T = 1000.\n\nAfter Poppy places a quarter: Pieces placed by Poppy = T/4 = 250. Remaining pieces = T - T/4 = (3/4)T = 750.\n\nThen her mom places a third of the remaining pieces: Pieces placed by mom = (1/3)(Remaining pieces) = (1/3)(750) = 250. Remaining pieces after mom = 750 - 250 = 500.\n\nSo, yeah, that's consistent. It seems like 500 pieces are left to place.\n\nJust to double-check, let's add up all the pieces placed and see if it adds up to the total minus the remaining.\n\nPoppy placed 250, mom placed 250, so total placed is 500. 1000 - 500 = 500 remaining. Perfect, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of fractions:\n\nAfter Poppy places 1/4, the remaining is 3/4. Then, her mom places 1/3 of that 3/4, which is (1/3)*(3/4) = 1/4. So, in total, pieces placed are 1/4 (Poppy) + 1/4 (mom) = 2/4 = 1/2. So, half of the pieces are placed, meaning half are remaining. Half of 1000 is 500. That's another way to see it, which also gives 500.\n\nWait, that's a neat way to think about it. By considering the fractions, Poppy places 1/4, then her mom places 1/3 of the remaining 3/4, which simplifies to 1/4 as well. So both placed 1/4 each, totaling 1/2, so 1/2 remains. That's a smarter way without dealing with the actual numbers until the end.\n\nSo, whether I calculate it step by step with numbers or use fractions, I get the same answer: 500 pieces remaining.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here.

So, first, I need to figure out how many cookies Cody eats, then add that to what Amir eats to get the total.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The problem says Cody eats three times more cookies than Amir. So if Amir eats a certain number, Cody eats three times that number. In this case, Amir eats 5 cookies. So, that means Cody must eat 3 times 5.\n\nLet me write that down. Amir's cookies = 5. Cody's cookies = 3 × Amir's cookies. So, 3 × 5. Hmm, 3 times 5 is 15. So, Cody eats 15 cookies. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, just to make sure. Sometimes, \"three times more\" can be confusing. Does it mean three times as much, or does it mean three times plus the original? Like, sometimes people might interpret it differently. But in this context, I think it's safer to assume it means three times as much. So, if Amir eats 5, then Cody eats 3 × 5, which is 15. That seems clear.\n\nSo, now, to find the total number of cookies they eat together, I just add Amir's and Cody's cookies. So, 5 (Amir) + 15 (Cody) = 20. So, together, they eat 20 cookies.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I should visualize it. Imagine Amir has 5 cookies. Now, Cody has three times more. So, if Amir has 5, then three times more would be 5 + 3×5? Wait, that would be 5 + 15 = 20, which is the same as before. Hmm, so whether it's three times as much or three times more, it seems to come to the same total.\n\nBut actually, no. If it's three times more, that might mean 3×5 added to the original 5, making it 20. But sometimes, people use \"times more\" to mean multiplication. So, in this case, since the problem is in French, \"trois fois plus\" is a bit tricky. Let me check the French translation again. \"Trois fois plus de biscuits\" – in French, does that mean three times as many or three times more?

So, the total is 5 + 15 = 20.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes \"three times more\" is interpreted as four times as much because it's 1× plus 3×. But in mathematical terms, I think \"three times more\" just means 3×, not 4×. So, it's 15. So, 5 + 15 is 20.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to interpret this. Maybe in some contexts, \"three times more\" could be 5 + 3 = 8, but that doesn't make sense because 3 is not a multiple of 5. So, no, that's not it.

{"idx": 106, "question": "Jean a 3 boîtes. Chaque boîte mesure 5 x 6 x 4 pouces. Les parois ont 1 pouce d'épaisseur. Quel est le volume intérieur total des 3 boîtes ?", "answer": "72", "raw_response": "Okay, so Jean has 3 boxes, and each box measures 5 x 6 x 4 inches. But the walls are 1 inch thick. I need to find the total interior volume of all three boxes. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the volume of a box is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. But since the walls have thickness, the interior dimensions will be smaller than the exterior ones. So, I can't just use the given measurements directly; I need to account for the walls.\n\nEach box has 1-inch thick walls. That means on each side of the box, there's a 1-inch wall. So, for example, the length of the box is 5 inches, but since there's a wall on both ends, the interior length would be 5 minus 2 inches (because 1 inch from each side). The same logic applies to the width and height.\n\nLet me write that down. For each dimension:\n\n- Length: 5 inches exterior\n- Width: 6 inches exterior\n- Height: 4 inches exterior\n\nEach dimension loses 2 inches (1 inch from each side) due to the walls. So, the interior dimensions would be:\n\n- Interior length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches\n- Interior width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches\n- Interior height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches\n\nWait, hold on. Is the height being reduced by 2 inches as well? The height is 4 inches, so if we subtract 2 inches, that leaves only 2 inches. That seems really small, but if the walls are 1 inch thick on the top and bottom, then yes, that's correct. The interior height is only 2 inches.\n\nSo, now that I have the interior dimensions, I can calculate the interior volume of one box. The formula for volume is length × width × height.\n\nCalculating the interior volume of one box:\n\n3 inches (length) × 4 inches (width) × 2 inches (height) = ?\n\nLet me do the multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, 3 × 4 = 12.\n\nThen, 12 × 2 = 24.\n\nSo, each box has an interior volume of 24 cubic inches.\n\nBut wait, is that right? Let me double-check the interior dimensions. If the exterior is 5 x 6 x 4, and walls are 1 inch, then:\n\n- For length: 5 - 2(1) = 3\n- For width: 6 - 2(1) = 4\n- For height: 4 - 2(1) = 2\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the interior volume is indeed 3 × 4 × 2 = 24 cubic inches per box.\n\nSince Jean has 3 such boxes, the total interior volume would be 24 × 3.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n24 × 3 = 72.\n\nSo, the total interior volume for all three boxes is 72 cubic inches.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me cross-verify. Each box is 5x6x4 inches externally, subtracting 2 inches from each dimension gives 3x4x2. 3x4 is 12, times 2 is 24. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if the walls are only on the sides, but in a box, typically, each dimension has walls on both ends. So, for example, in the length, there's a wall on the front and back, each 1 inch thick. Similarly for width and height.\n\nSo, that's why each dimension is reduced by 2 inches. So, the interior dimensions are 3x4x2.\n\nTherefore, volume per box is 24 cubic inches, three boxes would be 72.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in inches, so the volume is in cubic inches.

But the walls are 1 inch thick. I need to find the total interior volume of all three boxes. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the volume of a box is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. But since the walls have thickness, the interior dimensions will be smaller than the exterior ones. So, I can't just use the given measurements directly; I need to account for the walls.\n\nEach box has 1-inch thick walls. That means on each side of the box, there's a 1-inch wall. So, for example, the length of the box is 5 inches, but since there's a wall on both ends, the interior length would be 5 minus 2 inches (because 1 inch from each side). The same logic applies to the width and height.\n\nLet me write that down. For each dimension:\n\n- Length: 5 inches exterior\n- Width: 6 inches exterior\n- Height: 4 inches exterior\n\nEach dimension loses 2 inches (1 inch from each side) due to the walls. So, the interior dimensions would be:\n\n- Interior length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches\n- Interior width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches\n- Interior height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches\n\nWait, hold on. Is the height being reduced by 2 inches as well? The height is 4 inches, so if we subtract 2 inches, that leaves only 2 inches. That seems really small, but if the walls are 1 inch thick on the top and bottom, then yes, that's correct. The interior height is only 2 inches.\n\nSo, now that I have the interior dimensions, I can calculate the interior volume of one box. The formula for volume is length × width × height.\n\nCalculating the interior volume of one box:\n\n3 inches (length) × 4 inches (width) × 2 inches (height) = ?\n\nLet me do the multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, 3 × 4 = 12.\n\nThen, 12 × 2 = 24.\n\nSo, each box has an interior volume of 24 cubic inches.\n\nBut wait, is that right? Let me double-check the interior dimensions. If the exterior is 5 x 6 x 4, and walls are 1 inch, then:\n\n- For length: 5 - 2(1) = 3\n- For width: 6 - 2(1) = 4\n- For height: 4 - 2(1) = 2\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the interior volume is indeed 3 × 4 × 2 = 24 cubic inches per box.\n\nSince Jean has 3 such boxes, the total interior volume would be 24 × 3.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n24 × 3 = 72.\n\nSo, the total interior volume for all three boxes is 72 cubic inches.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me cross-verify. Each box is 5x6x4 inches externally, subtracting 2 inches from each dimension gives 3x4x2. 3x4 is 12, times 2 is 24. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if the walls are only on the sides, but in a box, typically, each dimension has walls on both ends. So, for example, in the length, there's a wall on the front and back, each 1 inch thick. Similarly for width and height.\n\nSo, that's why each dimension is reduced by 2 inches. So, the interior dimensions are 3x4x2.\n\nTherefore, volume per box is 24 cubic inches, three boxes would be 72.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in inches, so the volume is in cubic inches. So, 72 cubic inches.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if the walls are only on one side or something.

So, Frankie watches TV every evening after finishing his homework. We need to figure out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. Hmm, let's break down the information given.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we know:\n\n- **Monday and Tuesday:** Each day, Frankie watched one episode of his favorite show, and each episode is 1 hour long. So that's two days, one hour each. That should be 2 hours total for these two days.\n\n- **Wednesday:** He watched some episodes of a 30-minute show. We don't know how many yet, that's what we need to find out. Let's say he watched 'x' number of episodes on Wednesday. Since each episode is 30 minutes, that would be 0.5 hours per episode. So total time on Wednesday would be 0.5x hours.\n\n- **Thursday:** He finished his homework early and watched one 1-hour episode and one 30-minute show. So that's 1 hour plus 0.5 hours, totaling 1.5 hours.\n\n- **Friday:** He stayed up late because of the weekend and watched two 1-hour episodes. That's 2 hours.\n\nSo, let's add up all these hours and set them equal to the total he watched, which is 7 hours.\n\nSo, total hours = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday\n\nIn numbers:\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2\n\nLet me compute the constants first:\n\n1 (Monday) + 1 (Tuesday) = 2\n\nThen, 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 3.5\n\nSo, adding those together: 2 + 3.5 = 5.5 hours\n\nSo, the total is 5.5 hours from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday.\n\nBut the total he watched is 7 hours, so Wednesday must account for the remaining time.\n\nSo, 7 total hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours\n\nTherefore, Wednesday's TV time is 1.5 hours.\n\nSince each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours, we can find out how many episodes he watched by dividing the total time by the duration per episode.\n\nSo, number of episodes = 1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode\n\nCalculating that: 1.5 / 0.5 = 3\n\nSo, he watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.\n\nWait, let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nTotal hours:\n\nMonday: 1\n\nTuesday: 1\n\nWednesday: 0.5x\n\nThursday: 1 + 0.5 = 1.5\n\nFriday: 2\n\nSo, adding up the known hours: 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5\n\nTotal is 7, so 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours on Wednesday.\n\n1.5 hours divided by 0.5 hours per episode: 3 episodes.

Si quelqu'un achète 10 gallons d'essence, quel sera le prix d'achat, après les remboursements ?", "answer": "28", "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the final price someone pays for buying 10 gallons of gas at this gas station. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the station sells gas at $3.00 per gallon. So, without any discounts or rebates, the cost for 10 gallons would be straightforward. I can calculate that by multiplying the price per gallon by the number of gallons. \n\nSo, 10 gallons times $3.00 per gallon. Let me write that out:\n\n10 gallons * $3.00/gallon = $30.00\n\nAlright, so that's the initial cost before any rebates. Now, the app company offers a rebate of $0.20 per gallon if you fill up at this station. A rebate is like a discount you get after the purchase, right? So, it's not deducted at the time of purchase but is given back later. But in this case, the problem is asking for the price after the rebate, so I think I can subtract the rebate from the initial cost.\n\nSo, the rebate per gallon is $0.20. For 10 gallons, that would be:\n\n10 gallons * $0.20/gallon = $2.00\n\nTherefore, the total rebate is $2.00. Now, I need to subtract this rebate from the initial cost to find the final price.\n\nSo, initial cost is $30.00, rebate is $2.00. Let me subtract:\n\n$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Is the rebate applied per gallon, so for each gallon, you get 20 cents back? Yes, that's what it says. So, 10 gallons would give you 10 times 20 cents, which is $2.00. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the effective price per gallon after the rebate. So, the price per gallon is $3.00, and you get back $0.20, so effectively, it's $3.00 - $0.20 = $2.80 per gallon. Then, for 10 gallons, it would be 10 * $2.80 = $28.00. Yes, same result.\n\nHmm, so whether I calculate the rebate first and subtract it from the total or adjust the price per gallon first, I end up with the same final amount. That makes sense because it's just two different ways of looking at the same calculation.\n\nLet me verify once more to be sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe plug in the numbers again.\n\nInitial price: 10 gallons * $3.00/gallon = $30.00\n\nRebate: 10 gallons * $0.20/gallon = $2.00\n\nFinal price: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Another way: per gallon, after rebate, it's $3.00 - $0.20 = $2.80, so 10 gallons would be 10 * $2.80 = $28.00.\n\nWait, is there any chance the rebate is applied differently? Like, maybe it's 20% off or something? But the problem says 0.20$ de remboursement par gallon, which translates to $0.20 per gallon, not a percentage. So, it's a fixed amount per gallon, not a percentage discount. Therefore, my calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if it were a percentage, say 20% off, then the calculation would be different. But since it's $0.20 per gallon, it's a straight subtraction.\n\nSo, just to summarize:\n\n- Cost before rebate: $30.00\n- Rebate amount: $2.00\n- Cost after rebate: $28.00\n\nTherefore, the final price after the rebate is $28.00.\n\nI think that's thorough. I considered different ways to approach the problem, verified the calculations, and made sure I interpreted the rebate correctly as a fixed amount per gallon rather than a percentage. So, I feel confident that $28.00 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe price after remboursements will be \\boxed{28} dollars.\n</think>\n\nThe station sells gas at $3.00 per gallon.

So, the price per gallon is $3.00, and you get back $0.20, so effectively, it's $3.00 - $0.20 = $2.80 per gallon. Then, for 10 gallons, it would be 10 * $2.80 = $28.00. Yes, same result.\n\nHmm, so whether I calculate the rebate first and subtract it from the total or adjust the price per gallon first, I end up with the same final amount. That makes sense because it's just two different ways of looking at the same calculation.\n\nLet me verify once more to be sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe plug in the numbers again.\n\nInitial price: 10 gallons * $3.00/gallon = $30.00\n\nRebate: 10 gallons * $0.20/gallon = $2.00\n\nFinal price: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Another way: per gallon, after rebate, it's $3.00 - $0.20 = $2.80, so 10 gallons would be 10 * $2.80 = $28.00.\n\nWait, is there any chance the rebate is applied differently? Like, maybe it's 20% off or something? But the problem says 0.20$ de remboursement par gallon, which translates to $0.20 per gallon, not a percentage. So, it's a fixed amount per gallon, not a percentage discount. Therefore, my calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if it were a percentage, say 20% off, then the calculation would be different. But since it's $0.20 per gallon, it's a straight subtraction.\n\nSo, just to summarize:\n\n- Cost before rebate: $30.00\n- Rebate amount: $2.00\n- Cost after rebate: $28.00\n\nTherefore, the final price after the rebate is $28.00.\n\nI think that's thorough. I considered different ways to approach the problem, verified the calculations, and made sure I interpreted the rebate correctly as a fixed amount per gallon rather than a percentage. So, I feel confident that $28.00 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe price after remboursements will be \\boxed{28} dollars.", "answer_pred": "The station sells gas at $3.00 per gallon.

Hmm.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many roulés each of them ate in total. Let me start with Béatrice. She has two large roulés and 24 long ones.

Le bateau a commencé à prendre deux litres d'eau tous les dix pieds ramés en direction de la rive. Il lui a fallu seize secondes pour parcourir vingt pieds. La rive étant à 64 secondes, combien le bateau avait-il pris d'eau quand Julia a atteint la rive ?", "answer": "16", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Julia's boat started leaking while she was on the lake. The boat takes in two liters of water every ten feet she rows towards the shore. She took sixteen seconds to row twenty feet, and the shore was 64 seconds away. I need to find out how much water the boat had taken in by the time she reached the shore.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given:\n\n1. The boat takes in 2 liters of water every 10 feet rowed.\n2. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds.\n3. The total time to reach the shore is 64 seconds.\n\nHmm, so maybe I should start by figuring out her rowing speed. If she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, how much does she row in one second? Let me calculate that.\n\n20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.\n\nSo, her speed is 1.25 feet per second. That seems right.\n\nNow, the total time to reach the shore is 64 seconds. So, the distance she needs to cover is her speed multiplied by the time. Let me compute that.\n\nDistance = speed × time = 1.25 feet/second × 64 seconds.\n\nCalculating that: 1.25 × 64. Hmm, 1 × 64 is 64, and 0.25 × 64 is 16, so total is 64 + 16 = 80 feet.\n\nWait a second, so the distance to the shore is 80 feet? But she was rowing towards the shore, so that makes sense. So, the total distance she covered was 80 feet.\n\nNow, the boat takes in water based on the distance rowed. It takes in 2 liters every 10 feet. So, for every 10 feet she rows, 2 liters come in.\n\nTo find out how much water she took in, I need to calculate how many 10-foot segments are in the total 80 feet.\n\nNumber of 10-foot segments = total distance / 10 feet = 80 / 10 = 8.\n\nSo, that's 8 segments. Each segment brings in 2 liters, so total water taken in is 8 × 2 liters.\n\nCalculating that: 8 × 2 = 16 liters.\n\nWait, so does that mean the boat had taken in 16 liters of water by the time she reached the shore? That seems straightforward, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly.\n\nThe boat takes in water every 10 feet rowed, regardless of time. Julia rowed 80 feet, so 80 divided by 10 is 8. 8 times 2 liters is 16 liters. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the rate of water intake per second and then multiply by the total time. Let me try that approach to verify.\n\nFirst, her speed is 1.25 feet per second. So, per second, she's rowing 1.25 feet.\n\nThe boat takes in 2 liters every 10 feet. So, how much water does it take in per foot? 2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters per foot.\n\nTherefore, per foot, she takes in 0.2 liters. Since she rows 1.25 feet per second, the water intake rate is 0.2 liters/foot × 1.25 feet/second.\n\nCalculating that: 0.2 × 1.25 = 0.25 liters per second.\n\nSo, the boat is taking in water at a rate of 0.25 liters per second.\n\nNow, the total time is 64 seconds, so total water taken in is 0.25 liters/second × 64 seconds.\n\n0.25 × 64 = 16 liters.\n\nOkay, so this also gives 16 liters. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of how much water per second in another way. Let's see.\n\nShe rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, which we already found is 1.25 feet per second.\n\nThe water intake is 2 liters every 10 feet. So, in 10 feet, she takes 2 liters.\n\nHow much time does it take her to row 10 feet? At 1.25 feet per second, time = distance / speed = 10 / 1.25.\n\n10 divided by 1.25. Hmm, 1.25 × 8 = 10, so 8 seconds.\n\nSo, every 8 seconds, she takes in 2 liters of water.\n\nNow, the total time is 64 seconds. So, how many 8-second intervals are there in 64 seconds?\n\n64 / 8 = 8.\n\nSo, that's 8 intervals of 8 seconds each, each interval bringing in 2 liters. So, 8 × 2 = 16 liters.\n\nAgain, 16 liters. So, same answer.\n\nWait, so regardless of the method, I get 16 liters. Hmm. So, that seems consistent.\n\nBut let me just think again if there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs the 2 liters every 10 feet, regardless of the time it takes? Or is it 2 liters every 10 feet regardless of how fast she is going?\n\nIn the problem, it says \"Le bateau a commencé à prendre deux litres d'eau tous les dix pieds ramés en direction de la rive.\" So, \"the boat started taking two liters of water every ten feet rowed towards the shore.\" So, it's per ten feet rowed, so regardless of time.\n\nTherefore, my first approach is correct; it's based on distance, not time. So, since she rowed 80 feet, that's 80 / 10 = 8, times 2 liters is 16 liters.\n\nAlternatively, if the leak rate was based on time, say 2 liters every ten seconds, but that's not what the problem says. It says 2 liters every ten feet, so it's distance-based.\n\nTherefore, 16 liters is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Distance rowed: 80 feet\n- Water intake rate: 2 liters / 10 feet\n- Total water intake: (80 / 10) × 2 = 16 liters\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute the water intake per second:\n\n- 2 liters per 10 feet\n- 10 feet takes 8 seconds (as calculated earlier)\n- So, 2 liters per 8 seconds\n- Water intake rate: 2 / 8 = 0.25 liters per second\n- Total time: 64 seconds\n- Total water: 0.25 × 64 = 16 liters\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, I think 16 liters is the consistent answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe boat had taken in \\boxed{16} liters of water when Julia reached the shore.\n</think>\n\nJulia's boat started leaking while she was on the lake.

The whiteboard is shared among four teachers, each teaching two classes a day. Each class uses the whiteboard, and after each use, it's cleaned three times.

Then, with four teachers, it's 4 times 6, which is also 24. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is 24.

So, Ryan plants 2 flowers every day in his garden. Hmm, that sounds straightforward. But wait, it also says that 5 flowers didn't grow. I need to find out how many flowers he will have after 15 days.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, the number of flowers Ryan plants each day is 2. So, over 15 days, how many would that be? I think I can calculate that by multiplying the number of flowers per day by the number of days. So, 2 flowers/day * 15 days. Let me write that down:\n\n2 * 15 = 30.\n\nSo, Ryan would have planted 30 flowers in total after 15 days. But wait, the problem mentions that 5 flowers didn't grow. Does that mean out of the 30 he planted, 5 didn't make it? So, we need to subtract those 5 from the total planted to find out how many actually grew.\n\nLet me think about that. If he planted 30 flowers and 5 didn't grow, then the number of flowers that did grow would be 30 - 5. Calculating that:\n\n30 - 5 = 25.\n\nSo, does that mean Ryan will have 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days? That seems right. But let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. It says \"5 fleurs n'ont pas poussé,\" which translates to 5 flowers didn't grow. So, yeah, that should be subtracted from the total planted.\n\nWait, another thought: is the 5 flowers that didn't grow per day or in total? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but it just says \"5 fleurs n'ont pas poussé\" without mentioning a time frame. So, I think it's 5 flowers in total that didn't grow over the 15 days. So, subtracting 5 from the total of 30 makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if it was 5 flowers per day, the problem would probably say something like \"5 fleurs par jour n'ont pas poussé.\" Since it doesn't specify, I think it's 5 in total.

Since the photo has ducks, specifically, I think we can focus on the number of ducks. So, if there are Y ducks in the photo, Brittany's phone can store 50Y photos.\n\nThen, it tells us that Jamal's phone has a capacity of 1,800 photos. So, Jamal's phone can hold 1,800 photos.\n\nPutting this all together, let me define some variables to make it clearer.\n\nLet’s let Y be the number of ducks in Jamal's photo.\n\nBrittany's phone can store 50Y photos because it's 50 times the number of ducks.\n\nJamal's phone can store 6 times what Brittany's can, so Jamal's phone capacity is 6 * (Brittany's capacity). So, Jamal's capacity is 6 * 50Y.\n\nBut we know Jamal's capacity is 1,800 photos. So, 6 * 50Y = 1,800.\n\nLet me write that equation: 6 * 50Y = 1,800.\n\nSimplifying that, 6 times 50 is 300, so 300Y = 1,800.\n\nTo find Y, we can divide both sides by 300.\n\nSo, Y = 1,800 / 300.\n\nCalculating that, 1,800 divided by 300 is 6.\n\nSo, Y equals 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 ducks in the photo Jamal took.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1.

Si elle parvient à toutes les vendre, quel sera son bénéfice ?", "answer": "90", "raw_response": "Okay, so Sasha bought some lumber and now she wants to sell it because the prices went up. Hmm, let me figure out how much she spent and how much she can make by selling it. \n\nFirst, she has ten pieces of 2x4x10 boards. Each of those cost her $10. So, I need to calculate the total cost for those. That would be 10 boards multiplied by $10 each. Let me write that down: 10 * 10 = $100. So, she spent $100 on the 2x4x10 boards.\n\nNext, she also has five pieces of 4x4x10 boards. Each of these cost her $16. So, the total cost for these would be 5 boards multiplied by $16 each. Let me compute that: 5 * 16. Hmm, 16 times 5 is 80. So, she spent $80 on the 4x4x10 boards.\n\nWait, so altogether, how much did she spend initially? That would be the sum of the two amounts. So, $100 plus $80 is $180. So, her total cost was $180.\n\nNow, she wants to sell all these boards. But the question is, at what price? It says the prices have increased by 50% in the last few months. So, does that mean she can sell them at 50% higher than what she paid? I think that's the case.\n\nOkay, so the selling price for each type of board would be 50% more than her cost. Let's calculate that.\n\nStarting with the 2x4x10 boards. Each cost $10. A 50% increase would be 10 plus half of 10, which is 5. So, 10 + 5 = $15 per board. She has ten of these, so the total revenue from these would be 10 * 15.\n\nLet me compute that: 10 * 15 = $150.\n\nNow, for the 4x4x10 boards. Each cost $16. A 50% increase would be 16 plus half of 16, which is 8. So, 16 + 8 = $24 per board. She has five of these, so the total revenue from these would be 5 * 24.\n\nCalculating that: 5 * 24. Hmm, 24 times 5 is 120. So, she would make $120 from selling these.\n\nAdding both revenues together: $150 from the 2x4s and $120 from the 4x4s. So, 150 + 120 = $270.\n\nWait, hold on.

Calculez le nombre de cuillères à café qu'elle a versées, sachant qu'elle a utilisé un total de 120 cuillères à café de sucre et de tasses d'eau.", "answer": "42", "raw_response": "Okay, so Katy is making coffee, and she's using sugar and water in a ratio of 7 to 13. Hmm, that means for every 7 parts of sugar, she uses 13 parts of water. Got it. Now, the total she used is 120 units, which are a mix of sugar and water. I need to figure out how many tablespoons of sugar she used. \n\nWait, let me make sure I understand the units correctly. The problem says she used 120 cuillères à café de sucre et des tasses d'eau. Wait, hold on. Cuillères à café is tablespoons, right? But the water is measured in tasses, which is cups. So, she's using tablespoons of sugar and cups of water. That's a bit confusing because they are different units. But in the ratio, it's 7 parts sugar to 13 parts water. Hmm, so does that mean that the ratio is by volume, or by some other measure? \n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says she used a total of 120 cuillères à café de sucre et des tasses d'eau. So, that's 120 tablespoons of sugar and cups of water combined? Or is it 120 total parts? I think it's the latter. So, the total number of parts is 7 + 13, which is 20 parts. And these 20 parts correspond to 120 units. So, each part is 6 units, because 120 divided by 20 is 6. \n\nSo, if each part is 6 units, then the sugar, which is 7 parts, would be 7 times 6, which is 42 units. But wait, the units here are tablespoons for sugar and cups for water. Hmmm, so is the 120 total a combination of tablespoons and cups? That complicates things because they are different units. \n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again. \"Katy prépare du café en utilisant des cuillères à café de sucre et des tasses d'eau dans un ratio de 7 : 13. Calculez le nombre de cuillères à café qu'elle a versées, sachant qu'elle a utilisé un total de 120 cuillères à café de sucre et de tasses d'eau.\"\n\nSo, it's 7:13 ratio of sugar (cuillères à café) to water (tasses). The total used is 120 \"cuillères à café de sucre et de tasses d'eau.\" So, that seems like 120 in total, combining both sugar and water, but sugar is measured in tablespoons and water in cups. So, 120 is the total number of units, but the units are mixed. So, the 120 is 7 parts sugar (tablespoons) and 13 parts water (cups). That is, 7x tablespoons of sugar and 13x cups of water, such that 7x + 13x = 120. So, 20x = 120, so x = 6. Therefore, tablespoons of sugar would be 7x = 42. \n\nWait, so that would mean she used 42 tablespoons of sugar. But let me check the units again. Because, 7 parts sugar (tbsp) and 13 parts water (cups). So, 7x tablespoons + 13x cups = 120 units. But they are different units, so adding them directly might not make sense. \n\nBut maybe in the context, the problem is considering each part as a unit, regardless of the measurement. So, 7 parts sugar and 13 parts water, making 20 parts total. So, 20 parts equal 120 units, so each part is 6 units. Therefore, tablespoons of sugar would be 7 parts, which is 42 units, and cups of water would be 13 parts, which is 78 units. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the number of tablespoons of sugar she poured, so that would be 42. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the units because sugar is in tablespoons and water is in cups. So, is 1 cup equal to a certain number of tablespoons? For example, 1 cup is 16 tablespoons. So, if she's using 13 parts water, which is 78 cups, that would be a lot. But maybe in the problem, they are just considering the ratio in terms of parts, regardless of the actual volume. So, if the total parts are 20, and each part is 6, she pours 42 tablespoons of sugar and 78 cups of water. \n\nBut that seems like an enormous amount of water. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the ratio is 7 parts sugar to 13 parts water by volume, but she's measuring sugar in tablespoons and water in cups. So, if 1 cup is 16 tablespoons, then 13 cups would be 208 tablespoons. So, the ratio by tablespoons would be 7:208, which is a very different ratio. But the problem says the ratio is 7:13, so maybe the units are consistent in the ratio. So, 7 parts sugar (tablespoons) to 13 parts water (cups). So, perhaps the ratio is 7:13 in terms of tablespoons to cups. So, 7 tablespoons of sugar to 13 cups of water.\n\nThen, the total is 120 of what? If it's 7 tablespoons + 13 cups, but tablespoons and cups are different, so adding them together doesn't make sense. So, maybe the problem is just considering the total number of units regardless of type, but that seems odd. \n\nWait, maybe \"un total de 120 cuillères à café de sucre et de tasses d'eau\" means a total of 120 tablespoons of sugar and cups of water. So, like, 120 in total when you count the tablespoons of sugar and the cups of water. So, 7 parts sugar (tablespoons) and 13 parts water (cups) equals 20 parts. So, 20 parts = 120 units. So, each part is 6 units. Therefore, tablespoons of sugar = 7 * 6 = 42, and cups of water = 13 * 6 = 78. So, even though tablespoons and cups are different, the problem is just adding them as separate units? That seems a bit strange, but maybe that's how the problem is intended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is 7:13 by volume, regardless of the measurement. So, 7 parts sugar to 13 parts water, and the total volume is 120 units, but we need to convert the units to tablespoons or cups. But without knowing the conversion between tablespoons and cups, we can't really compute the exact amount. But the problem is asking for tablespoons of sugar, so perhaps the ratio is already given in tablespoons for sugar and cups for water, and the total is 120 in terms of units, meaning 120 tablespoons of sugar and cups of water combined.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in French, and the translation is a bit tricky. Let me look at the original French again: \"Katy prépare du café en utilisant des cuillères à café de sucre et des tasses d'eau dans un ratio de 7 : 13. Calculez le nombre de cuillères à café qu'elle a versées, sachant qu'elle a utilisé un total de 120 cuillères à café de sucre et de tasses d'eau.\"\n\nSo, \"utilisant des cuillères à café de sucre et des tasses d'eau\" meaning using tablespoons of sugar and cups of water. \"dans un ratio de 7 : 13.\" So, the ratio is 7:13 for sugar to water. Then, \"un total de 120 cuillères à café de sucre et de tasses d'eau.\" So, total of 120 tablespoons of sugar and cups of water.\n\nSo, in total, the sum of tablespoons of sugar and cups of water is 120. So, sugar is 7 parts, water is 13 parts, so total parts 20. Each part is 6 units. So, tablespoons of sugar = 7*6=42, cups of water=13*6=78. So, 42+78=120. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the number of tablespoons of sugar she poured is 42. So, the answer should be 42.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, is there another way to interpret this? Maybe the ratio is 7 tablespoons to 13 tablespoons, but water is measured in cups. So, 13 cups of water, which is equivalent to how many tablespoons? 13 cups * 16 tablespoons per cup is 208 tablespoons. So, the ratio would be 7:208, but the problem says 7:13, so that can't be. So, perhaps the ratio is considered in terms of the same unit. So, 7:13 in terms of tablespoons. So, if water is 13 tablespoons, which is 13/16 cups, but then the ratio would still be 7:13 tablespoons.\n\nBut the problem says she used 120 tablespoons of sugar and cups of water. So, maybe the units are being considered separately. So, tablespoons of sugar plus cups of water equals 120. So, 7x +13x =120, so x=6, so tablespoons of sugar is 42, cups of water is 78, totaling 120. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 42 tablespoons of sugar.\n\n**Final Answer**\nKaty a utilisé \\boxed{42} cuillères à café de sucre.\n</think>\n\nKaty prépare du café en utilisant des cuillères à café de sucre et des tasses d'eau dans un ratio de 7 : 13.

Calculez le nombre de conteneurs importés le deuxième jour, en supposant que tous les conteneurs contiennent 5 véhicules.", "answer": "4", "raw_response": "Okay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. So, the situation is about an agent at the main customs port in SeaSide who counted some containers. On the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Then, the next day, more containers arrived, and the total number of vehicles became 30. We need to find out how many containers arrived on the second day, assuming every container has 5 vehicles.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, on the first day, there were 2 containers. Each container has 5 vehicles. So, to find out how many vehicles were there on the first day, I can multiply the number of containers by the number of vehicles per container.\n\nSo, 2 containers * 5 vehicles per container = 10 vehicles. That makes sense because 2 times 5 is 10. So, there were 10 vehicles on the first day.\n\nThen, the next day, more containers arrived, and the total number of vehicles became 30. So, we need to figure out how many more vehicles arrived on the second day. To do that, I can subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles after the second day.\n\nSo, total vehicles after second day: 30\nVehicles on first day: 10\nTherefore, vehicles added on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.\n\nAlright, so 20 more vehicles arrived on the second day. Now, each container still has 5 vehicles, right? So, to find out how many containers arrived on the second day, I can divide the number of vehicles by the number of vehicles per container.\n\nSo, 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles per container = 4 containers.\n\nLet me just double-check that. If 4 containers arrived, each with 5 vehicles, that's 4*5=20 vehicles. Adding that to the original 10 vehicles gives us 30 vehicles in total. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I interpreted the question correctly. The agent counted 2 containers on the first day, each with 5 vehicles. Then, the next day, new containers arrived, bringing the total number of vehicles to 30. So, the total vehicles are 30, not the total containers. So, my calculation should be right because I subtracted the initial 10 vehicles from 30 to get 20, then divided by 5 to get 4 containers.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another way to think about this? Maybe someone might think that the 30 vehicles include both days, but since the agent is counting the total after the second day, it's correct to subtract the first day's vehicles.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 4 containers is the right answer.

So, the situation is about an agent at the main customs port in SeaSide who counted some containers. On the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Then, the next day, more containers arrived, and the total number of vehicles became 30. We need to find out how many containers arrived on the second day, assuming every container has 5 vehicles.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, on the first day, there were 2 containers. Each container has 5 vehicles. So, to find out how many vehicles were there on the first day, I can multiply the number of containers by the number of vehicles per container.\n\nSo, 2 containers * 5 vehicles per container = 10 vehicles. That makes sense because 2 times 5 is 10. So, there were 10 vehicles on the first day.\n\nThen, the next day, more containers arrived, and the total number of vehicles became 30. So, we need to figure out how many more vehicles arrived on the second day. To do that, I can subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles after the second day.\n\nSo, total vehicles after second day: 30\nVehicles on first day: 10\nTherefore, vehicles added on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.\n\nAlright, so 20 more vehicles arrived on the second day. Now, each container still has 5 vehicles, right? So, to find out how many containers arrived on the second day, I can divide the number of vehicles by the number of vehicles per container.\n\nSo, 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles per container = 4 containers.\n\nLet me just double-check that. If 4 containers arrived, each with 5 vehicles, that's 4*5=20 vehicles. Adding that to the original 10 vehicles gives us 30 vehicles in total. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I interpreted the question correctly. The agent counted 2 containers on the first day, each with 5 vehicles. Then, the next day, new containers arrived, bringing the total number of vehicles to 30. So, the total vehicles are 30, not the total containers. So, my calculation should be right because I subtracted the initial 10 vehicles from 30 to get 20, then divided by 5 to get 4 containers.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another way to think about this? Maybe someone might think that the 30 vehicles include both days, but since the agent is counting the total after the second day, it's correct to subtract the first day's vehicles.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 4 containers is the right answer.

Si les salaires d'Adrien et de Lylah ont augmenté simultanément, et qu'Adrien gagnait 40 000 $ il y a quatre ans, calculez le montant total de leurs deux salaires quatre ans plus tard.", "answer": "95200", "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the total salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, if I let Lylah's salary be some amount, Adrien's salary is 30% more than that. Then, four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what he was earning originally. It also mentions that their salaries increased simultaneously, so I think that means both got a raise at the same time. Additionally, it tells me that Adrien was earning $40,000 four years ago. I need to find the total of their salaries now.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand: four years ago, Adrien earned $40,000. His salary was 30% higher than Lylah's at that time. Then, both their salaries increased by 40% over the four years. So, I need to calculate their current salaries and add them together.\n\nLet me write down the given information:\n\n1. Four years ago, Adrien's salary (A_initial) was $40,000.\n2. At that time, Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's (L_initial). So, A_initial = L_initial + 30% of L_initial.\n3. Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his initial salary, so A_current = A_initial + 40% of A_initial.\n4. Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, so L_current = L_initial + 40% of L_initial.\n\nTherefore, the total current salaries would be A_current + L_current.\n\nLet me start by finding Lylah's initial salary. Since Adrien's initial salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, that means A_initial = L_initial * 1.30.\n\nWe know A_initial is $40,000, so:\n\n40,000 = L_initial * 1.30\n\nTo find L_initial, I can divide both sides by 1.30:\n\nL_initial = 40,000 / 1.30\n\nLet me compute that. 40,000 divided by 1.3.\n\nHmm, 1.3 times 30,000 is 39,000, right? Because 1.3 * 30,000 = 39,000. So 39,000 is 1.3 * 30,000. So, 40,000 is 1,000 more than 39,000. So, 1.3 * (30,000 + x) = 40,000.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Maybe just do the division.\n\n40,000 divided by 1.3: Let me see, 1.3 goes into 40,000 how many times?\n\nWell, 1.3 times 30,769 is approximately 40,000 because 1.3 * 30,000 = 39,000, and 1.3 * 769 is about 1,000. So, 30,769.23.\n\nWait, actually, 1.3 times 30,769.23 is 40,000. Let me check:\n\n30,769.23 * 1.3 = (30,769.23 * 1) + (30,769.23 * 0.3) = 30,769.23 + 9,230.77 = 40,000. Perfect.\n\nSo, L_initial is approximately $30,769.23.\n\nOkay, so four years ago, Lylah earned about $30,769.23, and Adrien earned $40,000.\n\nNow, both their salaries increased by 40% over four years. Let's calculate their current salaries.\n\nStarting with Adrien:\n\nA_current = A_initial + 40% of A_initial\nA_current = 40,000 + 0.4 * 40,000\nA_current = 40,000 + 16,000\nA_current = $56,000.\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, Lylah's current salary:\n\nL_current = L_initial + 40% of L_initial\nL_current = 30,769.23 + 0.4 * 30,769.23\n\nLet me compute 0.4 * 30,769.23:\n\n0.4 * 30,000 = 12,000\n0.4 * 769.23 = approximately 307.69\n\nSo, total increase is 12,000 + 307.69 = $12,307.69\n\nTherefore, L_current = 30,769.23 + 12,307.69\n\nLet me add those:\n\n30,769.23 + 12,307.69:\n\n30,769.23 + 12,000 = 42,769.23\n\n42,769.23 + 307.69 = 43,076.92\n\nSo, L_current is approximately $43,076.92\n\nTherefore, Adrien's current salary is $56,000, and Lylah's is approximately $43,076.92.\n\nNow, to find the total of their current salaries:\n\nTotal = 56,000 + 43,076.92\n\nLet me add those:\n\n56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92\n\nSo, the total is approximately $99,076.92\n\nBut let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFirst, L_initial was 40,000 / 1.3 = 30,769.23, correct.\n\nThen, A_current was 40,000 * 1.4 = 56,000, correct.\n\nL_current was 30,769.23 * 1.4, which is 30,769.23 * 1.4.\n\nLet me compute that as 30,769.23 * 1.4:\n\n30,769.23 * 1 = 30,769.23\n\n30,769.23 * 0.4 = 12,307.69\n\nAdding together: 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 = 43,076.92, which matches.\n\nSo, total is 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92\n\nHmm, so that's approximately $99,076.92.\n\nBut maybe I should represent it exactly. Since 40,000 / 1.3 is 30,769.230769..., so L_initial is 30,769.230769...\n\nMultiplying that by 1.4:\n\n30,769.230769... * 1.4\n\nLet me do it as fractions to see if it's exact.\n\nSince 40,000 / 1.3 is equal to 40,000 * (10/13) because 1.3 is 13/10.\n\nSo, 40,000 * (10/13) = (40,000 / 13) * 10\n\n40,000 divided by 13 is approximately 3,076.9230769...\n\nMultiply by 10: 30,769.230769...\n\nSo, L_initial is 30,769 and 23/92 dollars? Wait, no, 0.230769 is 23/99, but it's recurring.\n\nAnyway, so L_current is 30,769.230769... * 1.4.\n\nSimilarly, 1.4 is 14/10 or 7/5.\n\nSo, 30,769.230769... * 7/5.\n\nWhich is (30,769.230769... * 7) / 5.\n\n30,769.230769 * 7: Let's compute.\n\n30,769.230769 * 7:\n\n30,000 * 7 = 210,000\n\n769.230769 * 7: Let's compute 700*7=4,900, 69.230769*7≈484.615183\n\nSo total is 4,900 + 484.615183 ≈ 5,384.615183\n\nTherefore, 30,769.230769 * 7 ≈ 210,000 + 5,384.615183 ≈ 215,384.615183\n\nThen, divide by 5: 215,384.615183 / 5 ≈ 43,076.9230366...\n\nSo, L_current is approximately 43,076.9230366...\n\nWhich is 43,076.92 when rounded to the nearest cent.\n\nSo, Adrien's current salary is exactly 56,000, and Lylah's is approximately 43,076.92.\n\nAdding them together gives exactly 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92\n\nSo, the total is $99,076.92\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to compute this without calculating each salary separately.\n\nWe know that both salaries increased by 40%, so their current salaries are 1.4 times their initial salaries.\n\nSo, the total current salary is 1.4*(A_initial + L_initial)\n\nWe know A_initial is 40,000, and L_initial is 30,769.23\n\nSo, A_initial + L_initial = 40,000 + 30,769.23 = 70,769.23\n\nThen, multiply by 1.4: 70,769.23 * 1.4\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n70,769.23 * 1.4:\n\n70,000 * 1.4 = 98,000\n\n769.23 * 1.4: Let's compute 700*1.4=980, 69.23*1.4≈96.922\n\nSo, total is 980 + 96.922≈1,076.922\n\nTherefore, total current salary is 98,000 + 1,076.922≈99,076.922, which is approximately $99,076.92, same as before.\n\nSo, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the total of their two salaries four years later is $99,076.92.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's see if the problem says anything about rounding. It doesn't specify, so since we're dealing with money, it's standard to round to the nearest cent, which is two decimal places. So, $99,076.92 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we do it with exact fractions:\n\nA_initial is 40,000, which is 40,000/1.\n\nL_initial is 40,000 / 1.3, which is 40,000 / (13/10) = 40,000 * (10/13) = 400,000 / 13.\n\nSo, L_initial is 400,000 / 13.\n\nTherefore, A_initial + L_initial is 40,000 + 400,000 / 13.\n\nConvert 40,000 to 520,000 / 13 (since 40,000 * 13 = 520,000)\n\nSo, 520,000 / 13 + 400,000 / 13 = 920,000 / 13\n\nThen, their total current salary is 1.4 * (920,000 / 13)\n\n1.4 is 14/10, so:\n\n14/10 * 920,000 / 13 = (14 * 920,000) / (10 * 13)\n\nCompute numerator: 14 * 920,000 = 12,880,000\n\nDenominator: 10 * 13 = 130\n\nSo, 12,880,000 / 130\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 1,288,000 / 13\n\nCompute 1,288,000 ÷ 13:\n\n13 * 99,000 = 1,287,000\n\nSo, 1,288,000 - 1,287,000 = 1,000\n\nSo, 1,288,000 / 13 = 99,000 + (1,000 / 13)\n\n1,000 / 13 ≈ 76.9230769\n\nSo, total is 99,000 + 76.9230769 ≈ 99,076.9230769...\n\nWhich is approximately $99,076.92 when rounded to the nearest cent.\n\nTherefore, that's another way to confirm the same result.\n\nSo, I think I've done this correctly. Calculated Lylah's initial salary, found both current salaries by increasing them by 40%, and added them together. Cross-checked by calculating the total initial salary and then increasing by 40%, which gave the same result. So, confident that the total is $99,076.92.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total of their two salaries four years later is \\boxed{99076.92} dollars.\n</think>\n\nFirst, we know that Adrien's initial salary (A_initial) was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's initial salary (L_initial).

Wait, no, 0.230769 is 23/99, but it's recurring.\n\nAnyway, so L_current is 30,769.230769... * 1.4.\n\nSimilarly, 1.4 is 14/10 or 7/5.\n\nSo, 30,769.230769... * 7/5.\n\nWhich is (30,769.230769... * 7) / 5.\n\n30,769.230769 * 7: Let's compute.\n\n30,769.230769 * 7:\n\n30,000 * 7 = 210,000\n\n769.230769 * 7: Let's compute 700*7=4,900, 69.230769*7≈484.615183\n\nSo total is 4,900 + 484.615183 ≈ 5,384.615183\n\nTherefore, 30,769.230769 * 7 ≈ 210,000 + 5,384.615183 ≈ 215,384.615183\n\nThen, divide by 5: 215,384.615183 / 5 ≈ 43,076.9230366...\n\nSo, L_current is approximately 43,076.9230366...\n\nWhich is 43,076.92 when rounded to the nearest cent.\n\nSo, Adrien's current salary is exactly 56,000, and Lylah's is approximately 43,076.92.\n\nAdding them together gives exactly 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92\n\nSo, the total is $99,076.92\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to compute this without calculating each salary separately.\n\nWe know that both salaries increased by 40%, so their current salaries are 1.4 times their initial salaries.\n\nSo, the total current salary is 1.4*(A_initial + L_initial)\n\nWe know A_initial is 40,000, and L_initial is 30,769.23\n\nSo, A_initial + L_initial = 40,000 + 30,769.23 = 70,769.23\n\nThen, multiply by 1.4: 70,769.23 * 1.4\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n70,769.23 * 1.4:\n\n70,000 * 1.4 = 98,000\n\n769.23 * 1.4: Let's compute 700*1.4=980, 69.23*1.4≈96.922\n\nSo, total is 980 + 96.922≈1,076.922\n\nTherefore, total current salary is 98,000 + 1,076.922≈99,076.922, which is approximately $99,076.92, same as before.\n\nSo, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the total of their two salaries four years later is $99,076.92.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's see if the problem says anything about rounding. It doesn't specify, so since we're dealing with money, it's standard to round to the nearest cent, which is two decimal places. So, $99,076.92 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we do it with exact fractions:\n\nA_initial is 40,000, which is 40,000/1.\n\nL_initial is 40,000 / 1.3, which is 40,000 / (13/10) = 40,000 * (10/13) = 400,000 / 13.\n\nSo, L_initial is 400,000 / 13.\n\nTherefore, A_initial + L_initial is 40,000 + 400,000 / 13.\n\nConvert 40,000 to 520,000 / 13 (since 40,000 * 13 = 520,000)\n\nSo, 520,000 / 13 + 400,000 / 13 = 920,000 / 13\n\nThen, their total current salary is 1.4 * (920,000 / 13)\n\n1.4 is 14/10, so:\n\n14/10 * 920,000 / 13 = (14 * 920,000) / (10 * 13)\n\nCompute numerator: 14 * 920,000 = 12,880,000\n\nDenominator: 10 * 13 = 130\n\nSo, 12,880,000 / 130\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 1,288,000 / 13\n\nCompute 1,288,000 ÷ 13:\n\n13 * 99,000 = 1,287,000\n\nSo, 1,288,000 - 1,287,000 = 1,000\n\nSo, 1,288,000 / 13 = 99,000 + (1,000 / 13)\n\n1,000 / 13 ≈ 76.9230769\n\nSo, total is 99,000 + 76.9230769 ≈ 99,076.9230769...\n\nWhich is approximately $99,076.92 when rounded to the nearest cent.\n\nTherefore, that's another way to confirm the same result.\n\nSo, I think I've done this correctly. Calculated Lylah's initial salary, found both current salaries by increasing them by 40%, and added them together. Cross-checked by calculating the total initial salary and then increasing by 40%, which gave the same result. So, confident that the total is $99,076.92.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total of their two salaries four years later is \\boxed{99076.92} dollars.", "answer_pred": "First, we know that Adrien's initial salary (A_initial) was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's initial salary (L_initial).

{"idx": 120, "question": "Miguel utilise 2 cartons de papier par semaine pour son dessin. Si chaque carton contient 30 feuilles de papier, combien de feuilles de papier utilise-t-il par mois ?", "answer": "240", "raw_response": "Okay, so Miguel uses 2 cartons de papier par semaine for his drawing. Each carton has 30 feuilles de papier. I need to figure out how many feuilles he uses par mois. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that he uses 2 cartons each week. Each carton has 30 feuilles, so to find out how many feuilles he uses per week, I should multiply the number of cartons by the number of feuilles per carton. That would be 2 cartons/week * 30 feuilles/carton. Let me do that math: 2 times 30 is 60. So, Miguel uses 60 feuilles par semaine.\n\nNow, the question is about how many he uses par mois. I need to figure out how many weeks are in a month. Hmm, this might be a bit tricky because the number of weeks can vary depending on the month. Some months have 4 weeks, and others have 5 weeks. But usually, when people talk about \"par mois,\" they might be referring to an average month or maybe a specific number of weeks.\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify that. If I assume there are 4 semaines par mois, which is common for estimations, then I can calculate the monthly usage. So, 60 feuilles/semaine multiplied by 4 semaines/mois. Let me calculate that: 60 times 4 is 240. So, that would be 240 feuilles par mois.\n\nBut wait, hold on. If I consider a month as 4 semaines, that's 28 jours. But most months are longer than that. They have 30 or 31 jours, which would be a little more than 4 semaines. For example, 30 jours would be about 4 semaines et 2 jours. So, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of jours instead of semaines. He uses 2 cartons par semaine, so per jour, he uses 2 cartons divided by 7 jours. That would be 2/7 cartons per day. Since each carton has 30 feuilles, then per jour, he uses (2/7)*30 feuilles. Let me calculate that: 2 divided by 7 is approximately 0.2857. Multiply that by 30: 0.2857 * 30 is about 8.571 feuilles per day.\n\nNow, if I want to find out how many feuilles he uses par mois, I need to know how many jours are in a month. Let's take an average month length. Hmm, months have 28 to 31 jours. If I take 30 jours as an average, then 8.571 feuilles/jour * 30 jours/mois would give me the monthly usage.\n\nCalculating that: 8.571 * 30. Let me do that step by step. 8 * 30 is 240, and 0.571 * 30 is approximately 17.13. So, adding those together, 240 + 17.13 is 257.13. So, approximately 257.13 feuilles par mois.\n\nHmm, but earlier I got 240 when assuming 4 semaines. So, there's a difference here. Maybe the question expects a simpler calculation, assuming 4 semaines par mois. Let me check both approaches.\n\nFirst approach: 2 cartons/week * 30 feuilles/carton = 60 feuilles/week. If 4 weeks/month, then 60 * 4 = 240 feuilles/month.\n\nSecond approach: Calculating per day and then multiplying by 30 days: 2/7 * 30 = ~8.571 feuilles/day. 8.571 * 30 = ~257.13 feuilles/month.\n\nSo, which one is more accurate? Well, it depends on whether the month is considered as exactly 4 weeks or as 30 jours. In reality, most months have more than 4 semaines, so 257 might be a better estimate. But sometimes, for simplicity, people use 4 semaines par mois.\n\nLooking back at the question: \"combien de feuilles de papier utilise-t-il par mois?\" It doesn't specify whether to use 4 semaines or the exact number of jours, so I might need to make an assumption. Since the original usage is given par semaine, maybe it's safer to stick with 4 semaines par mois, as that would be the straightforward approach.\n\nTherefore, Miguel uses 2 cartons/week * 30 feuilles/carton = 60 feuilles/week. Over 4 weeks, that's 60 * 4 = 240 feuilles par mois.\n\nAlternatively, if the month is considered as 30 jours, then we have 2 cartons/week, which is about 0.2857 cartons per day. 0.2857 cartons/day * 30 jours = 8.571 cartons/month. But wait, that doesn't make sense because each carton is 30 feuilles. Wait, no, actually, 0.2857 cartons per day is 0.2857 * 30 feuilles per day, which is about 8.571 feuilles per day. Then, 8.571 * 30 jours is 257.13 feuilles par mois.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Maybe instead of converting to jours, I can calculate the number of semaines in a month. Since a month is approximately 4.345 semaines (since 365 jours divided by 7 is about 52.14 semaines, so 365 / 12 ≈ 30.42 jours/mois, which is about 4.345 semaines/mois). So, using that, Miguel uses 2 cartons/week, so 2 * 4.345 ≈ 8.69 cartons par mois. Each carton is 30 feuilles, so 8.69 * 30 ≈ 260.7 feuilles par mois.\n\nHmm, so that's approximately 261 feuilles par mois. But this is getting complicated. Maybe the question expects a simpler answer, assuming 4 semaines par mois, leading to 240 feuilles. Alternatively, if it's 30 jours, it's about 257, but that's not a whole number.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the exact number of jours in a month. If the month has 30 jours, then 30 jours / 7 jours par semaine ≈ 4.2857 semaines. So, 2 cartons/week * 4.2857 weeks ≈ 8.571 cartons. Then, 8.571 cartons * 30 feuilles/carton ≈ 257.13 feuilles.\n\nBut if the month has 31 jours, then it's approximately 4.4286 semaines. So, 2 * 4.4286 ≈ 8.857 cartons, which is 8.857 * 30 ≈ 265.71 feuilles.\n\nSimilarly, for a 28-jour month, it's exactly 4 semaines, so 2 * 4 = 8 cartons, which is 240 feuilles.\n\nSo, depending on the month, it could be between 240 and 265.71 feuilles. But since the question is general, maybe we can take an average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects a simple multiplication without considering the exact number of weeks or days. So, 2 cartons par semaine, 30 feuilles par carton, so 60 feuilles par semaine. Then, 60 * 4 = 240 par mois. That seems straightforward.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is 240 feuilles par mois. But just to be thorough, let me check the exact calculation.\n\nIf we take a month as 30 jours, then the number of semaines is 30 / 7 ≈ 4.2857. So, 2 cartons/week * 4.2857 weeks ≈ 8.571 cartons. 8.571 * 30 ≈ 257.14 feuilles.\n\nBut 257.14 is approximately 257 feuilles, but since we can't have a fraction of a feuille, it would be 257 or 258. But this is getting too precise, and perhaps the question expects a simpler answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can convert the weekly usage to monthly by multiplying by 4.33 (since 12 months have about 52 semaines, so 52 / 12 ≈ 4.33 semaines per month). So, 2 cartons/week * 4.33 ≈ 8.66 cartons/month. 8.66 * 30 ≈ 259.8 feuilles, which is approximately 260.\n\nHmm, so depending on the approach, it's either 240, 257, or 260. But I think the simplest way, as per the question, is to assume 4 semaines par mois, leading to 240 feuilles. Because if we consider the exact number, it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting a multiplication without considering the weeks, just 2 cartons par semaine, 4 semaines par mois, so 2 * 4 = 8 cartons, 8 * 30 = 240 feuilles.\n\nYes, that seems to be the most straightforward answer. So, Miguel utilise 240 feuilles de papier par mois.\n\n**Final Answer**\nMiguel utilise \\boxed{240} feuilles de papier par mois.\n</think>\n\nMiguel utilise 2 cartons de papier par semaine pour son dessin.

Because if we consider the exact number, it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting a multiplication without considering the weeks, just 2 cartons par semaine, 4 semaines par mois, so 2 * 4 = 8 cartons, 8 * 30 = 240 feuilles.\n\nYes, that seems to be the most straightforward answer. So, Miguel utilise 240 feuilles de papier par mois.\n\n**Final Answer**\nMiguel utilise \\boxed{240} feuilles de papier par mois.", "answer_pred": "Miguel utilise 2 cartons de papier par semaine pour son dessin.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette and half as many oranges. I need to find the total number of fruits they brought together. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many fruits Morisette brought. She has 5 apples and 8 oranges. So, adding those together, that's 5 + 8. Let me write that down: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits. Okay, so Morisette contributed 13 fruits in total.\n\nNow, onto Kael. The problem says Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette. Morisette had 5 apples, so twice that would be 5 * 2. Let me calculate that: 5 * 2 = 10 apples. So, Kael has 10 apples.\n\nNext, it mentions that Kael brought half as many oranges as Morisette. Morisette had 8 oranges, so half of that would be 8 / 2. Calculating that: 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, Kael has 4 oranges.\n\nNow, let's find out how many fruits Kael brought in total. He has 10 apples and 4 oranges, so adding those together: 10 + 4 = 14 fruits. Okay, so Kael contributed 14 fruits.\n\nTo find the total number of fruits they both brought, I need to add Morisette's fruits and Kael's fruits together. Morisette had 13, and Kael had 14.

So, altogether, they brought 27 fruits.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For Morisette: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits. That seems right. For Kael: twice the apples, so 5*2=10, and half the oranges, so 8/2=4. 10+4=14. Then, 13 +14=27. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total number of apples and the total number of oranges separately and then add them together.

Combien de miles aura-t-elle parcouru en 7 heures ?", "answer": "50", "raw_response": "Okay, let me see. So, the problem is about Rosie who is running at different speeds and we need to figure out how many miles she has covered in 7 hours. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\n\"Rosie court à une vitesse de 10 miles par heure pendant 3 heures. Ensuite, elle court 5 miles par heure. Combien de miles aura-t-elle parcouru en 7 heures ?\"\n\nAlright, so first, she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. Then, she runs at 5 miles per hour. We need to find out how many miles she has run in 7 hours total.\n\nWait, so she runs for 3 hours at 10 mph, and then continues running at 5 mph for the remaining time. So, the total time is 7 hours, which means the time she runs at 5 mph is 7 minus 3, which is 4 hours.\n\nLet me compute the distance she covers during each part and then add them together. That makes sense because distance is speed multiplied by time. So, for the first part, distance1 = speed1 * time1, and for the second part, distance2 = speed2 * time2.\n\nCalculating distance1: 10 mph * 3 hours. That should be 30 miles. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, for the second part, she runs at 5 mph for 4 hours. So, distance2 = 5 mph * 4 hours. Let me calculate that. 5 times 4 is 20. So, 20 miles.\n\nNow, to find the total distance, I just add both distances together. So, 30 miles plus 20 miles equals 50 miles. So, Rosie would have covered 50 miles in 7 hours.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst segment: 10 mph for 3 hours. 10*3=30. That's correct.\n\nSecond segment: 5 mph for 4 hours. 5*4=20. Correct.\n\nTotal distance: 30+20=50. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of average speed or something, but I don't think that's necessary here because the speeds are constant during each segment. So, splitting the journey into two parts and adding the distances is the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to visualize it, I could imagine a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is distance. The first 3 hours would be a straight line with a steeper slope (10 mph), and then the next 4 hours would have a less steep slope (5 mph). The total distance would be the sum of the areas under each segment, which are rectangles. So, 10*3 and 5*4, which is again 30 and 20, totaling 50.\n\nI guess another way to see it is to compute the total time and ensure I'm not adding speeds or something incorrectly. But no, she's running at different speeds during different time intervals, so the distances should be additive.\n\nIs there a possibility that the problem meant she runs at 10 mph for 3 hours, and then at 5 mph for a certain distance, but then the total time is 7 hours? Hmm, the wording in French says \"Ensuite, elle court 5 miles par heure.\" That translates to \"Then, she runs at 5 miles per hour.\" It doesn't specify the distance, so I think it's implying that she continues running at 5 mph for the remaining time until the total time is 7 hours.\n\nSo, yeah, that's why I subtracted 3 hours from 7 to get the time for the second part, which is 4 hours.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said she runs 5 miles in the second part, then we would compute the time taken for that, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct. She runs 30 miles in the first part and 20 miles in the second part, totaling 50 miles.\n\nLet me just think if there's another interpretation. For example, maybe she alternates between 10 mph and 5 mph every hour? But the problem says she runs at 10 mph for 3 hours, then at 5 mph. So, it's a continuous 3 hours at 10, then the rest at 5. So, the rest would be 4 hours at 5 mph.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in kilometers? But no, it's specified as miles. So, 10 miles per hour, 5 miles per hour.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes in these problems, they might have different interpretations of \"elle court 5 miles par heure\". Maybe it's 5 miles in total? But that wouldn't make much sense because it would say \"5 miles\" instead of \"5 miles per hour\". So, I think it's safe to assume that it's 5 mph.\n\nSo, yeah, the total distance is 30 + 20 = 50 miles.\n\nWait, another sanity check: if she ran the entire 7 hours at 10 mph, she would have gone 70 miles. But she slows down to 5 mph for the last 4 hours, so she loses 5 mph for 4 hours, which is 20 miles. So, 70 - 20 = 50. That's another way to think about it, which confirms the same answer. So, that gives me more confidence that 50 miles is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if she ran at 5 mph the entire time, she would have gone 35 miles. But she speeds up to 10 mph for the first 3 hours, which is 5 mph extra for 3 hours, so that's 15 extra miles. So, 35 + 15 = 50. Again, same answer. So, that's another verification method.\n\nSo, all the different ways I think about it lead me to the same conclusion: 50 miles.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the multiple methods confirm the result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nRosie aura parcouru \\boxed{50} miles en 7 heures.\n</think>\n\nRosie court à une vitesse de 10 miles par heure pendant 3 heures.

So, 10 miles per hour, 5 miles per hour.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes in these problems, they might have different interpretations of \"elle court 5 miles par heure\". Maybe it's 5 miles in total? But that wouldn't make much sense because it would say \"5 miles\" instead of \"5 miles per hour\". So, I think it's safe to assume that it's 5 mph.\n\nSo, yeah, the total distance is 30 + 20 = 50 miles.\n\nWait, another sanity check: if she ran the entire 7 hours at 10 mph, she would have gone 70 miles. But she slows down to 5 mph for the last 4 hours, so she loses 5 mph for 4 hours, which is 20 miles. So, 70 - 20 = 50. That's another way to think about it, which confirms the same answer. So, that gives me more confidence that 50 miles is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if she ran at 5 mph the entire time, she would have gone 35 miles. But she speeds up to 10 mph for the first 3 hours, which is 5 mph extra for 3 hours, so that's 15 extra miles. So, 35 + 15 = 50. Again, same answer. So, that's another verification method.\n\nSo, all the different ways I think about it lead me to the same conclusion: 50 miles.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the multiple methods confirm the result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nRosie aura parcouru \\boxed{50} miles en 7 heures.", "answer_pred": "Rosie court à une vitesse de 10 miles par heure pendant 3 heures.

{"idx": 124, "question": "Jennie apporte une assistance au bureau de sa mère. Elle dispose d'une pile de 60 lettres à timbrer et d'une autre avec des lettres déjà timbrées. Elle tamponne un tiers des lettres à timbrer. S'il y a maintenant 30 lettres dans la pile de lettres timbrées, combien y en avait-il dans cette pile lorsque Jennie a commencé le travail ?", "answer": "10", "raw_response": "Okay, so Jennie is helping her mom at the office, and she has two piles of letters: one with 60 letters that need to be stamped, and another pile that already has stamps on them. She stamps a third of the letters that need to be stamped. After she does that, there are now 30 letters in the already-stamped pile. The question is asking how many letters were in that already-stamped pile when Jennie started working.\n\nLet me break this down step by step. First, Jennie has 60 letters that need to be stamped. She stamps a third of them. So, I need to figure out how many letters that is. A third of 60 is calculated by dividing 60 by 3. Let me write that out: 60 ÷ 3 = 20. So Jennie stamps 20 letters.\n\nNow, she adds these 20 stamped letters to the pile that already had some letters. After adding these, the total number of letters in the stamped pile becomes 30. So, I can represent this with an equation. Let me call the original number of letters in the stamped pile \"x\". Then, after adding 20 letters, the total becomes x + 20 = 30.\n\nTo find out what x was, I just need to solve for x. Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation gives me x = 30 - 20. So, x = 10. That means there were originally 10 letters in the stamped pile before Jennie started adding more.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. If there were 10 letters to start with, Jennie adds 20, which brings the total to 30. Yes, that makes sense. And she took a third of 60, which is 20, so all the numbers add up. So, yeah, the original number must have been 10.\n\nHmm, another way to think about it is to visualize the two piles. Before she starts, there's a pile of 60 letters needing stamps and another pile with some number of already stamped letters. She stamps 20, moving them from the unsorted pile to the sorted pile. So, the sorted pile increases by 20 to become 30. Therefore, it must have been 30 minus 20, which is 10. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here. It's straightforward: she stamps a third of 60, which is 20, and that brings the total stamped pile to 30, so subtracting the 20 she added from the 30 gives the original count. So, 30 minus 20 is 10. That should be the answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Letters needing stamps: 60\n2. Letters stamped by Jennie: 60 ÷ 3 = 20\n3. After stamping, total in stamped pile: 30\n4. Therefore, original stamped pile: 30 - 20 = 10\n\nYep, that all adds up correctly.
